    # Applies to MaxAge usage and would rarely be changed, but is a
    # nice feature to understand.
    #
    # When the container first starts and the pool is filled to the
    # minimum size, all those "minimum" instances will have the same
    # creation time and therefore all expire at the same time dictated
    # by the `MaxAge` setting.  To protect against this sudden drop
    # scenario and provide a more gradual expiration from the start
    # the container will spread out the age of the instances that fill
    # the pool to the minimum using an offset.
    #
    # The `MaxAgeOffset` is not the final value of the offset, but
    # rather it is used in creating the offset and allows the
    # spreading to push the initial ages into the future or into the
    # past.  The pool is filled at startup as follows:
    #
    #     for (int i = 0; i &lt; poolMin; i++) {
    #         long ageOffset = (maxAge / poolMin * i * maxAgeOffset) % maxAge;
    #         pool.add(new Bean(), ageOffset));
    #     }
    #
    # The default `MaxAgeOffset` is -1 which causes the initial
    # instances in the pool to live a bit longer before expiring.  As
    # a concrete example, let's say the MinSize is 4 and the MaxAge is
    # 100 years.  The generated offsets for the four instances created
    # at startup would be 0, -25, -50, -75.  So the first instance
    # would be "born" at age 0, die at 100, living 100 years.  The
    # second instance would be born at -25, die at 100, living a total
    # of 125 years.  The third would live 150 years.  The fourth 175
    # years.
    #
    # A `MaxAgeOffset` of 1 would cause instances to be "born" older
    # and therefore die sooner.  Using the same example `MinSize` of 4
    # and `MaxAge` of `100 years`, the life spans of these initial four
    # instances would be 100, 75, 50, and 25 years respectively.
    #
    # A `MaxAgeOffset` of 0 will cause no "spreading" of the age of the
    # first instances used to fill the pool to the minimum and these
    # instances will of course reach their MaxAge at the same time.
    # It is possible to set to decimal values such as -0.5, 0.5, -1.2,
    # or 1.2.

    # will have their `@PreDestroy` methods called during finalization.

    # In the OpenJDK VM the `-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB` flag can adjust
    # how aggressively SoftReferences are collected.  The default
    # OpenJDK setting is 1000, resulting in inactive pooled instances
    # living one second of lifetime per free megabyte in the heap, which
    # is very aggressive.  The setting should be increased to get the
    # most out of the `GarbageCollection` feature of the pool.  Much
    # higher settings are safe.  Even a setting as high as 3600000 (1
    # hour per free MB in the heap) does not affect the ability for the

    #
    # Instances in use are excluded from sweeping.  Should an instance
    # expire while in use it will be evicted immediately upon return
    # to the pool.  Effectively `MaxAge` and flushes will be enforced as
