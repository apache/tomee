  #  The passivator is responsible for writing beans to disk

  #  by setting this property to the fully qualified class name

  #  is not responsible for invoking any callbacks or other
  #  processing, its only responsibly is to write the bean state
  #  to disk.

  #  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This

  #  A value of zero would mean no timeout.

<Container id="My Stateless Container" type="STATELESS">

  # Specifies the time an invokation should wait for an instance
  # of the pool to become available.
  #
  # After the timeout is reached, if an instance in the pool cannot
  # be obtained, the method invocation will fail.

  # seconds, minutes, hours, days.  Or any combination such as
  # "1 hour and 27 minutes and 10 seconds"

  AccessTimeout = 0 milliseconds

  # Specifies the size of the bean pools for this stateless
  # SessionBean container.  If StrictPooling is not used, instances
  # will still be created beyond this number if there is demand, but
  # they will not be returned to the pool and instead will be
  # immediately destroyed.

  MaxSize = 10

  # Specifies the minimum number of bean instances that should be in
  # the pool for each bean.  Pools are prefilled to the minimum on
  # startup.  Note this will create start order dependencies between
  # other beans that also eagerly start, such as other @Stateless
  # beans with a minimum or @Singleton beans using @Startup.  The
  # @DependsOn annotation can be used to appropriately influence
  # start order.
  #
  # The minimum pool size is rigidly maintained.  Instances in the
  # minimum side of the pool are not eligible for IdleTimeout or
  # GarbageCollection, but are subject to MaxAge and flushing.
  #
  # If the pool is flushed it is immediately refilled to the minimum
  # size with MaxAgeOffset applied.  If an instance from the minimum
  # side of the pool reaches its MaxAge, it is also immediately
  # replaced.  Replacement is done in a background queue using the
  # number of threads specified by CallbackThreads.

  MinSize = 0

  # StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool
  # reaches it's maximum size and there are incoming requests that
  # need instances.
  #
  # With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances to
  # become available. The pool size will never grow beyond the the
  # set MaxSize value.  The maximum amount of time a request should
  # wait is specified via the AccessTimeout setting.
  #
  # Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary
  # instances to meet demand. The instances will last for just one
  # method invocation and then are removed.
  #
  # Setting StrictPooling to false and MaxSize to 0 will result in
  # no pooling. Instead instances will be created on demand and live
  # for exactly one method call before being removed.

  StrictPooling = true

  # Specifies the maximum time that an instance should live before
  # it should be retired and removed from use.  This will happen
  # gracefully.  Useful for situations where bean instances are
  # designed to hold potentially expensive resources such as memory
  # or file handles and need to be periodically cleared out.
  #
  # Usable time units: nanoseconds, microsecons, milliseconds,
  # seconds, minutes, hours, days.  Or any combination such as
  # "1 hour and 27 minutes and 10 seconds"

  MaxAge = 0 hours

  # Specifies the maximum time that an instance should be allowed to
  # sit idly in the pool without use before it should be retired and
