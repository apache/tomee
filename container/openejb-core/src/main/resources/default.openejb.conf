<Container id="My CMP Container" type="CMP_ENTITY">
  # This container can service CMP 1.1 and 2.x Entity Beans
  #
  # Persistence is achived by taking the entity beans deployed
  # and internally readapting them to the new EJB 3.0 JPA (Java
  # Persistence API) specification.  It is possible, though
  # not well documented, to mix in newer JPA concepts with
  # old style Entity beans allowing you to slowly transition
  # your entities to JPA.  Aggressively inquiring on the
  # users@openejb.apache.org about this feature will help
  # us generate better documentation.
  # ---------

  # ConnectorName is he id of the Connector element which
  # should provide connectivity for this CMP Container

<Container id="My BMP Container" type="BMP_ENTITY">

  # Specifies the size of the bean pools for this

  #  The passivator is responsible for writing beans to disk
  #  at passivation time. Different passivators can be used
  #  by setting this property to the fully qualified class name
  #  of the PassivationStrategy implementation. The passivator
  #  is not responsible for invoking any callbacks or other
  #  processing, its only responsibly is to write the bean state
  #  to disk.
  #
  #  Known implementations:
  #     org.apache.openejb.core.stateful.RAFPassivater
  #     org.apache.openejb.core.stateful.SimplePassivater

  Passivator   org.apache.openejb.core.stateful.SimplePassivater

  #  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This
  #  value is measured in minutes. A value of 5 would
  #  result in a time-out of 5 minutes between invocations.
  #  A value of zero would mean no timeout.

  TimeOut  20

  #  Specifies the size of the bean pools for this
  #  stateful SessionBean container.

  PoolSize  1000

  #  Property name that specifies the number of instances
  #  to passivate at one time when doing bulk passivation.
  #  Must be less than the PoolSize.

  BulkPassivate  100

<Container id="My Stateless Container" type="STATELESS">
  #  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This
  #  value is measured in milliseconds.  A value of 5 would
  #  result in a time-out of 5 milliseconds between invocations.
  #  A value of zero would mean no timeout.

  TimeOut  0

  #  Specifies the size of the bean pools for this
  #  stateless SessionBean container.

  PoolSize  10

  #  StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool
  #  reaches it's maximum size and there are incoming requests
  #  that need instances.
  #
  #  With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances
  #  to become available.  The pool size will never grow beyond the
  #  the set PoolSize value.
  #
  #  Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary
  #  instances to meet demand.  The instances will last for just one
  #  method invocation and then are removed.
