#  processing, its only responsibly is to write the bean state
#  to disk.

    Passivator   org.apache.openejb.core.stateful.SimplePassivater

#  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This

#  Specifies the size of the bean pools for this

#  Property name that specifies the number of instances

    PoolSize  10

#  StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool
#  reaches it's maximum size and there are incoming requests
#  that need instances.
#
#  With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances
#  to become available.  The pool size will never grow beyond the
#  the set PoolSize value.
#
#  Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary
#  instances to meet demand.  The instances will last for just one
#  method invocation and then are removed.
