/**
 * 17.6.2.1 NotSupported
 *
 * The Container invokes an enterprise Bean method whose transaction attribute
 * is set to NotSupported with an unspecified transaction context.
 *
 * If a client calls with a transaction context, the container suspends the
 * association of the transaction context with the current thread before
 * invoking the enterprise bean's business method. The container resumes the
 * suspended association when the business method has completed. The suspended
 * transaction context of the client is not passed to the resource managers or
 * other enterprise Bean objects that are invoked from the business method.
 *
 * If the business method invokes other enterprise beans, the Container passes
 * no transaction context with the invocation.
 *
 * Refer to Subsection 17.6.5 for more details of how the Container can
 * implement this case.
