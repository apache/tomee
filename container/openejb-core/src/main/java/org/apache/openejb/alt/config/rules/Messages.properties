1.missing.class           Missing class
2.missing.class           Missing class {0} 
3.missing.class           The class {0} not found. Check that the class specified in the {1} element for bean {2} is spelled correctly and the class is present in the jar

# 0 - Class name

1.wrong.class.type        Wrong class type
2.wrong.class.type        Wrong class type {0}
3.wrong.class.type        The class {0} is the wrong type, it does not extend {1}

# 0 - method name
# 1 - full method
# 2 - remote|home

# 4 - EJB Class name
1.no.busines.method       No such business method
2.no.busines.method       Business method {0} not implemented.
3.no.busines.method       Business method {1} not implemented. The method was declared in the {2} interface {3}, but not implemented in the ejb class {4}

# 0 - home interface
# 1 - remote interface
1.no.home.create          No create method.  
2.no.home.create          No create method in {0}.
3.no.home.create          The home interface {0} must declare at least one create method. Example:\n\n\tpublic {1} create() throws javax.ejb.CreateException, java.rmi.RemoteException;

# 1 - EJB Class name
# 2 - create params
1.session.no.ejb.create     Create method not implemented.
2.session.no.ejb.create     Create method not implemented: ejbCreate({1}).
3.session.no.ejb.create     There should be a create method in the bean class {0} with the following signature:\n\n\tpublic void ejbCreate({1}) throws javax.ejb.CreateException

# 1 - EJB Class name
# 2 - primary key class
# 3 - create params
1.entity.no.ejb.create    Create method not implemented.
2.entity.no.ejb.create    Create method not implemented: ejbCreate({2}).
3.entity.no.ejb.create    There should be a create method in the bean class {0} with the following signature:\n\n\tpublic {1} ejbCreate({2}) throws javax.ejb.CreateException

# 1 - EJB Class name
# 2 - create params
1.no.ejb.post.create      No ejbPostCreate method
2.no.ejb.post.create      Missing create method: ejbPostCreate({1})
3.no.ejb.post.create      Entity create method with no matching ejbPostCreate.  There should be an ejbPostCreate method in the bean class {0} with the following signature:\n\n\tpublic void ejbPostCreate({1}) throws javax.ejb.CreateException

# 1 - bean class
# 2 - create params
# 3 - home interface
1.unused.ejb.create       Unused ejbCreate method
2.unused.ejb.create       Unused ejbCreate method: ejbCreate({1})
3.unused.ejb.create       Create method will never be called.  The bean class {0} defines the create method ejbCreate({1}), but there is no matching create({1}) method in the home interface {2}

1.misslocated.class           Misslocated class
2.misslocated.class           Misslocated class {0} 
3.misslocated.class           The class {0} was found in a parent classloader and was loaded from there rather than this jar.  However, a dependent class {3} was not found in the parent classloader.  \n\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n\nOne, remove the class {0} from the jar in the parent classloader to ensure the class is only loaded from this jar.\n\nTwo, move the dependent class {3} and any other dependent classes into the jar in the parent classloader.  \n\nMore information can be found at http://www.openejb.org/faq_validation.html#misslocated.class
