/**
 * 17.6.2.3 Supports
 *
 * The Container invokes an enterprise Bean method whose transaction attribute
 * is set to Supports as follows.
 *
 * If the client calls with a transaction context, the Container performs the
 * same steps as described in the Required case.
 *
 * If the client calls without a transaction context, the Container performs the
 * same steps as described in the NotSupported case.
 *
 * The Supports transaction attribute must be used with caution. This is because
 * of the different transactional semantics provided by the two possible modes
 * of execution. Only the enterprise beans that will execute correctly in both
 * modes should use the Supports transaction attribute.
