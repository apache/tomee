/**
 * 17.6.2.4 RequiresNew
 *
 * The Container must invoke an enterprise Bean method whose transaction
 * attribute is set to RequiresNew with a new transaction context.
 *
 * If the client invokes the enterprise Bean's method while the client is not
 * associated with a transaction context, the container automatically starts a
 * new transaction before delegating a method call to the enterprise Bean
 * business method. The Container automatically enlists all the resource
 * managers accessed by the business method with the transaction. If the
 * business method invokes other enterprise beans, the Container passes the
 * transaction context with the invocation. The Container attempts to commit the
 * transaction when the business method has completed. The container performs
 * the commit protocol before the method result is sent to the client.
 *
 * If a client calls with a transaction context, the container suspends the
 * association of the transaction context with the current thread before
 * starting the new transaction and invoking the business method. The container
 * resumes the suspended transaction association after the business method and
 * the new transaction have been completed.
