    # Determines wether or not this data source should be JTA managed
    # or user managed.  If set to 'true' it will automatically be enrolled
    # in any ongoing transactions.  Calling begin/commit/rollback or setAutoCommit
    # on the datasource or connection will not be allowed.  If you need to perform
    # these functions yourself, set JtaManaged to 'false'
    #
    # In terms of JPA persistence.xml:

    # number for no limit.

    MaxIdle	20

    # The minimum number of connections that can remain idle in

    # create none.

    MinIdle	0

    # The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait

    # indefinitely.

    ValidationQuery

    # If true connections will be validated before being returned

    # NOTE - for a true value to have any effect, the

    # The number of connectionss to examine during each run of the
    # idle connection evictor thread (if any).
