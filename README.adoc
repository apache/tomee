=== To start developing TomEE

TomEE is open source and you can help in its creation.

Apache TomEE is built with Apache Maven >= 3.3.9 and Java 8. The
http://tomee.apache.org/community/sources.html[Contribute to TomEE]
section from the official website for a complete Git, Github, Build,
Test, and Continuous Integration details.

==== Quick build

If you only like to compile all classes and package up TomEE _without_
running tests then you can use the following build options

....
mvn -Pquick -Dsurefire.useFile=false -DdisableXmlReport=true -DuniqueVersion=false -ff -Dassemble -DskipTests -DfailIfNoTests=false clean install
....

==== Full build

This will run all the tests. We have thousands of tests and you should
go out to grab a bite in the meantime.

....
mvn clean install
....

If you intend building in environments where multicast is not allowed
then build with:

....
mvn clean install -DskipMulticastTests=true
....

Full build that execute arquillian test on all TomEE distributions:

....
mvn clean install -Pall-adapters
....

==== Partial build

This will only build a module and the modules using it as a dependency.

To build just TomEE distribution execute:

....
mvn clean install -pl tomee/apache-tomee -am -Dmaven.test.skip=true
....

TomEE zip/tar.gz will be in tomee/apache-tomee/target

To build TomEE Embedded to be able to develop with its maven plugin
execute:

....
mvn clean install -pl maven/tomee-embedded-maven-plugin -am -Dmaven.test.skip=true
....
