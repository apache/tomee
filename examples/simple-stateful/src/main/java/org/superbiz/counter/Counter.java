/**
 * This is an EJB 3 style pojo stateful session bean
 * Every stateful session bean implementation must be annotated
 * using the annotation @Stateful
 * This EJB has 2 business interfaces: CounterRemote, a remote business
 * interface, and CounterLocal, a local business interface
 *
 * Per EJB3 rules when the @Remote or @Local annotation isn't present
 * in the bean class (this class), all interfaces are considered
 * local unless explicitly annotated otherwise.  If you look
 * in the CounterRemote interface, you'll notice it uses the @Remote
 * annotation while the CounterLocal interface is not annotated relying
 * on the EJB3 default rules to make it a local interface.
