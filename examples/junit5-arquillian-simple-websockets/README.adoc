== junit5-simple-websockets-arquillian

A simple Websocket example project.

The example was created with a server to server typo of connection in
mind. For Browser to server connections, you will need to refer to your
frontend framework of choice but many server side configurations in here
can be reused.

There is an Arquillian test that will test the connection and sent a message using **JUnit 5**.
