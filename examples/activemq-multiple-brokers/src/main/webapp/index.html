      <title>Fun with SSE and JMS</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  <p>This example demonstrates how to send Server Side Events, and how to receive them, both using a JAX-RS client,
  and also in Javascript in your web-browser.</p>
  <p>You should be able to send messages to an ActiveMQ topic called 'EVENT' using the OpenWire port tcp/61616 on this machine.
  Any messages sent to this topic will appear below.</p>

  <div id="messages">

  </div>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    var es = new EventSource('jms');
    var messages = document.getElementById('messages');

    es.onmessage = function(e) {
      var newElement = document.createElement("p");

      newElement.textContent = e.data;
      messages.appendChild(newElement);
    }
  </script>
  </body>
