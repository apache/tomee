  <!-- By default, a bean archive has no enabled interceptors bound via interceptor 
    bindings. An interceptor must be explicitly enabled by listing its class 
    under the element of the beans.xml file of the bean archive. The order of 
    the interceptor declarations determines the interceptor ordering. Interceptors 
    which occur earlier in the list are called first. If the same class is listed 
    twice under the interceptors element, the container automatically detects 
    the problem and treats it as a deployment problem. -->
