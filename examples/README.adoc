= TomEE Examples

These examples demonstrate particular features of the Java EE ecosystem to help
developers in the creation of their own applications.

The idea is that each example focuses in a very specific framework feature and
demonstrates its usage and behaviour in a simple way.

== Rules to create a new example.

* Demo just one feature with simple business logic.
* Don't use more than 4 names in the example's name.
Like in the _cdi-basic_ example where @Inject is demontrated in the _Course_ class.
* If your example has already 1000 lines, consider either simplifying it or split it.
* Don't define a Parent in maven's _pom.xml_. This will make the project completely self contained and independent,
making the required dependencies clear.
* Make sure you only include dependencies that are realy needed.
* Always include an integration test with Arquillian or ApplicationComposer.
* Document the bahaviour of each method with javadoc.
* Include a README file explining the purpose and what's doing on.
* Make sure you add the new project to the parent project _pom.xml_ modules section.
