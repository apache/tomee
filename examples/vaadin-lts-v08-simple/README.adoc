=== Support Informationâ€™s

Vaadin Framework 8 is the latest version based on GWT. V8 itself is a
LTS version.

The new Vaadin Platform is based on WebComponents. As of Vaadin 10,
Vaadin is moving to a release train model with four major releases every
year. This allows them to ship new features faster to developers. Vaadin
is continuing their commitment to long-term stability with long-term
support (LTS) releases. The LTS releases will come out approximately
every two years and offer 5 years of support.
