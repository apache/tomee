== Spring Data sample

This example uses OpenEJB hooks to replace an EJB implementation by a
proxy to uses Spring Data in your preferred container.

It is pretty simple: simply provide to OpenEJB an InvocationHandler
using delegating to spring data and that’s it!

It is what is done in `org.superbiz.dynamic.SpringDataProxy`.

It contains a little trick: even if it is not annotated
`implementingInterfaceClass` attribute is injected by OpenEJB to get
the interface.

Then we simply create the Spring Data repository and delegate to it.
