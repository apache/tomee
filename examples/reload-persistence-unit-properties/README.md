title=Reload Persistence Unit Properties
~~~~~~

This example aims to simulate a benchmark campaign on JPA.

First you'll run your application then you'll realize you need an L2 cache to conform to your Service Level Agreement (SLA).

So you change your persistence.xml configuration, then restart your application,
you wait a bit because you are using OpenEJB ;)...but you wait...

So to try to go faster on long campaign simply change your configuration at runtime to test it then when it works change
your configuration file to keep the modification.

To do it we can simply use JMX.

OpenEJB automatically registers one MBean by entitymanager (persistence unit).

It allows you to change your persistence unit properties even if more is possible.

## The test itself

The test is simple: we persist an entity, we query it three times without cache then we activate cache and realize
running again our queries that one is enough to do the same.

# The output

In the ouput we find the 3 parts described just before.
