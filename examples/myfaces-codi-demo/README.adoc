==== Intro of MyFaces CODI and ExtVal

The Apache MyFaces Extensions CDI project (aka CODI) hosts portable
extensions for Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI - JSR 299). CODI
is a toolbox for your CDI application. Like CDI itself CODI is focused
on type-safety. It is a modularized and extensible framework. So itâ€™s
easy to choose the needed parts to facilitate the daily work in your
project.

MyFaces Extensions Validator (aka ExtVal) is a JSF centric validation
framework which is compatible with JSF 1.x and JSF 2.x. This example
shows how it improves the default integration of Bean-Validation
(JSR-303) with JSF2 as well as meta-data based cross-field validation.
