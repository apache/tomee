== Spring Data With Meta sample

This example simply simplifies the usage of spring-data sample providing
a meta annotation `@SpringRepository` to do all the dynamic proxy EJB job.

It replaces @Proxy and @Stateless annotations.

Isn’t it more comfortable?

To do it we defined a meta annotation ``Metatype` and used it.

The proxy implementation is the same than for spring-data sample.
