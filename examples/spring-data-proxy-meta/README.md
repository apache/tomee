# Spring Data With Meta sample #

This example simply simplifies the usage of spring-data sample
providing a meta annotation @SpringRepository to do all the dynamic procy EJB job.

It replaces @Proxy and @Stateless annotations.

Isn't it more comfortable?

To do it we defined a meta annotation "Metatype" and used it.

The proxy implementation is the same than for spring-data sample.
