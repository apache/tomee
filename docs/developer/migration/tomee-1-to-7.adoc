== Breaking changes

- Artifact coordinates changes

GroupId changed from `org.apache.openejb` to `org.apache.tomee`.
It includes maven plugins which use now `org.apache.tomee.maven` and the `javaee-api`.

Versions of openejb and tomee are now aligned on 7.x and you don't need to use
4.x and 1.x (or any variant) for openejb and tomee.

- JAX-RS 2 specification refined the sorting of providers. It can have side effects for message body
readers/writers which don't define their target mediatype properly like Jackson which uses wildcard instead of
a json related mediatype. To solve it register a custom provider redefining the media type.

Can be as easy as:

[source,java]
----
@Provider
@Consumes("application/json")
@Produces("application/json")
public class MyAppJsonProvider extends JacksonJsonProvider {
}
----

- JPA and CDI are linked now, enabling JPA to use CDI for its components but CDI can use JPA too...
to solve issues with hibernate you need to add either as system property or persistence unit `tomee.jpa.factory.lazy = true`.
