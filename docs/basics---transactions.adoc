One of the many benefits of EJB, is that
transactions within the EJB container are generally managed entirely
automatically. Any EJB component will, by default, partake in that
transaction.

Here are some basic rules to understand about transactions. Keep note
that this is the default behaviour, and the system can be configured to
behave differently, depending on the needs of your system, bean, or
individual methods of your beans.

== Participants

Various components and parts of the EJB system can be part of a
transaction. Examples are

[arabic]
. Session bean
. Message Driven Bean
. EntityManager (a.k.a. Persistence context)

== Behaviour

The basic default behaviours are 1. A transaction starts at the
beginning of the first EJB method call, in a chain of calls that are
participating in the given transaction 1. A transaction ends at the end
of the first EJB method, in the same chain 1. If a bean that has started
a transaction, uses another bean, that bean will automatically use the
same transaction as the calling bean.

== Configuration

You can configure your beans in a variety of ways. Generally speaking, a
transaction is started when a method is called, but can be configured
using @TransactionAttribute(value = TransactionAttributeType.X), where X
is one of...

[arabic]
. REQUIRED - the default, which is to start a transaction if one does
not exist, but to use the existing one if it has already been started.
. REQUIRES_NEW - the transaction is created on every call, and ends when
the call is completed. Beans don't partake in transactions created by
other parts of the system.
. MANDATORY - a transaction must always exist prior to the call, and it
will be used. It is an error otherwise
. NOT_SUPPORTED - component not included in the transaction
. SUPPORTS - transaction will be used if it exists, but will not be
created if it does not exist
. NEVER - if a transaction exists, it is an error to call the method

@TransactionAttribute applies to both methods and entire beans. You may
set one type of transaction behaviour (as seen above) on the bean, and a
different one on a specific method of that same bean, which overrides
the one configured for the overall bean. For instance, maybe you want to
make an audit entry in the database that you are about to attempt a
credit card payment. It really needs to be in it's own transaction so
that it is IMMEDIATELY committed for audit purposes, if something goes
wrong with the credit card payment. So, perhaps you use MANDATORY on the
bean, and REQUIRES_NEW on the method for audit logging. As soon as the
method that does the audit logging is complete, the transaction is
committed, and the credit card payment transaction continues on it's
way.
