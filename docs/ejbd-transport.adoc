# Ejbd Transport

The Ejbd Transport allows to remotely access EJBs that have a remote
interface. Nevertheless it is not based on IIOP.

Ejbd Transport is different using TomEE or OpenEJB.

In OpenEJB it uses openejb http layer and ejbd is configured through
ejbd service (same for ejbds). So to activate/deactivate them use
conf/ejbd(s).properties files. You can set property disabled to true if
you don't want them to be started.

In TomEE the transport is the Tomcat one. It uses a servlet brought by
TomEE webapp. Here is the servlet as defined in TomEE webapp:

....
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>ServerServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.apache.openejb.server.httpd.ServerServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>ServerServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/ejb/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
....

You can easily remove it if you don't use remote EJBs. Another way is to
deactivate the servlet using the "activated" init parameter of the
servlet.

Finally you can move this servlet in your own webapp if you want to use
a provider url containing your webapp context. Simply copy paste the
servlet definition in your web.xml and set the url mapping to what you
want (let say /foo/*). Then use the provider url
http://<host>:<port>/<webapp context name>/foo

== Remote communication and serialization

Remotely calling EJBs, independent of using Ejbd or other RMI/IIOP based
protocols, involves serialization and deserialization of objects.
Deserializing unknown content coming from an untrusted source imposes a
security risk as the stream could be manipulated. A much publicized
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313[vulnerability] was found in the
commons-collections library which allowed to remotely execute arbitrary
code simply by deserializing instances of the class
`InvokerTransformer`.

To prevent this risk TomEE and the OpenEJB client since 1.7.4 before
deserializing every object checks its class against a configurable
blacklist and a whitelist. The default black list is defined as `*`,
meaning that requests cannot be deserialized at all and the Ejbd
transport in fact cannot be used.

The blacklist and whitelist is configured via the system properties:

* `tomee.serialization.class.whitelist`
* `tomee.serialization.class.blacklist`

You will also find these properties in
link:properties-listing.html[System Properties Listing]

These rules apply for the whitelist:

* The whitelist has a lower priority than the blacklist. That means a
class that is part of the blacklist cannot be whitelisted and will
always be refused.
* If a whitelist is not defined, either by not defining the property at
all or defining it with an empty value, every class is on the whitelist.
In this case only the blacklist applies.
* If a whitelist is defined it must be a comma separated list of
prefixes of fully qualified class names. Then deserialization of an
object fails if its class is not part of this whitelist. A class is on
the whitelist if its fully qualified classname is prefixed by one of the
values in the whitelist.

These rules apply for the blacklist:

* If the blacklist should be deactivated it must be configured to the
value `-`. This will open your system to the serialization vulnerability
if you don't configure a whitelist!
* If the blacklist is not configured its default value is
`org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.,org.apache.commons.collections.functors.,org.apache.xalan,java.lang.Process`
so that for example the class
`org.apache.commons.collections.functors.InvokerTransformer` cannot be
deserialized.
* If the blacklist is configured with an empty value the blacklist is
effectively `*`, therefore preventing any Ejbd communication.
* If you want to blacklist certain classes the property must be
configured to a comma separated list of prefixes of fully qualified
class names. A class is on the blacklist if its fully qualified
classname is prefixed by one of the values in the blacklist.

The default for `tomee.serialization.class.whitelist` is empty, the
default for `tomee.serialization.class.blacklist` is `*` since TomEE
1.7.4.

If an EJB request fails because a class is not whitelisted you will find
this log entry:

....
WARN - "null OEJP/4.7" FAIL "Security error - foo.Bar is not whitelisted as deserializable, prevented before loading it." - Debug for StackTrace
....

If you trust this class and want to support serialization in remote
communication you have to configure these properties appropriately both
on server side as well as on client side.

If you only want to support serialization of the classes `foo.Bar` and
`foo.Baz` you can configure the properties like this:

....
tomee.serialization.class.whitelist = foo.Bar,foo.Baz
tomee.serialization.class.blacklist = -
....

If you trust all classes in the package `foo` define the properties like
this:

....
tomee.serialization.class.whitelist = foo.
tomee.serialization.class.blacklist = -
....

(Don't forget the trailing `.` after foo, as it will also whitelist all
classes in the package `foo2` otherwise.)

If you trust all classes in the package `foo` except the class `foo.Bar`
you have to configure the properties like this:

....
tomee.serialization.class.whitelist = foo.
tomee.serialization.class.blacklist = foo.Bar
....

=== Revert to behavior of TomEE 1.7.3

TomEE 1.7.3 already contained a fixed blacklist that was not
configurable and contained the packages org.codehaus.groovy.runtime,
org.apache.commons.collections.functors and org.apache.xalan including
subpackages and the class java.lang.Process. If you know that your
applications runs on TomEE 1.7.3 but does not on TomEE 1.7.4 showing the
aforementioned log message, you can define the configuration so that the
serialization will work in the same way as it did with TomEE 1.7.3:

....
tomee.serialization.class.whitelist = 
tomee.serialization.class.blacklist = org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.,org.apache.commons.collections.functors.,org.apache.xalan,java.lang.Process
....

Please note that with this configuration your server may be vulnerable
to Java serialization attacks not yet identified by the Zero Day
initiative. Also note that the following versions of the affected
libraries have been patched and approved by the Zero Day initiative and
_may_ be safe to deserialize.

* Groovy 2.4.4
* Commons Collections 3.2.2
* Xalan 2.7.2

As Ejbd transport is tunneled over HTTP please make sure that the
`ServerServlet` is not publicly accessible. When the applications
running on TomEE do not package the `ServerServlet` themselves ensure
that the URL http://<host>:<port>/tomee/ejb is not accessible from
untrusted sources.

If your applications package declare it in their own web.xml make sure
that the respective URL is not accessible from untrusted sources.

=== Revert to behavior of TomEE 1.7.2

TomEE 1.7.2 did not have any kind of blacklist when deserializing
objects over Ejbd. If you want to revert to this behavior you can simply
deactivate the blacklist with this configuration:

....
tomee.serialization.class.whitelist =
tomee.serialization.class.blacklist = -
....

Note that this configuration makes your system highly vulnerable to
serialization attacks! Consider your system as unsafe!

=== Remote communication and Arquillian tests

The mechanism described above principally also works when running
Arquillian tests. As the Ejbd transport is already used for deploying
applications all Arquillian tests would fail with the default settings.

Therefore the TomEE Arquillian adapter automatically starts the
container so that all classes except for a set of well-know dangerous
classes are whitelisted.

As Ejbd is by default disabled since TomEE 7.0.0, the TomEE Arquillian
adapter automatically activates it when starting a remote container.

=== Remote communication and the TomEE Maven Plugin

The same mentioned above on Arquillian and TomEE is also valid when
using the TomEE Maven Plugin.
