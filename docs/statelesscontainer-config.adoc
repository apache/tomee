A StatelessContainer can be declared via xml in the
`<tomee-home>/conf/tomee.xml` file or in a `WEB-INF/resources.xml` file
using a declaration like the following. All properties in the element
body are optional.

....
<Container id="myStatelessContainer" type="STATELESS">
    accessTimeout = 30 seconds
    callbackThreads = 5
    closeTimeout = 5 minutes
    garbageCollection = false
    idleTimeout = 0 minutes
    maxAge = 0 hours
    maxAgeOffset = -1
    maxSize = 10
    minSize = 0
    replaceAged = true
    replaceFlushed = false
    strictPooling = true
    sweepInterval = 5 minutes
</Container>
....

Alternatively, a StatelessContainer can be declared via properties in
the `<tomee-home>/conf/system.properties` file or via Java
VirtualMachine `-D` properties. The properties can also be used when
embedding TomEE via the `javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer` API or
`InitialContext`

....
myStatelessContainer = new://Container?type=STATELESS
myStatelessContainer.accessTimeout = 30 seconds
myStatelessContainer.callbackThreads = 5
myStatelessContainer.closeTimeout = 5 minutes
myStatelessContainer.garbageCollection = false
myStatelessContainer.idleTimeout = 0 minutes
myStatelessContainer.maxAge = 0 hours
myStatelessContainer.maxAgeOffset = -1
myStatelessContainer.maxSize = 10
myStatelessContainer.minSize = 0
myStatelessContainer.replaceAged = true
myStatelessContainer.replaceFlushed = false
myStatelessContainer.strictPooling = true
myStatelessContainer.sweepInterval = 5 minutes
....

Properties and xml can be mixed. Properties will override the xml
allowing for easy configuration change without the need for $\{} style
variable substitution. Properties are not case sensitive. If a property
is specified that is not supported by the declared StatelessContainer a
warning will be logged. If a StatelessContainer is needed by the
application and one is not declared, TomEE will create one dynamically
using default settings. Multiple StatelessContainer declarations are
allowed. # Supported Properties

expired instances.

== accessTimeout

Specifies the time an invokation should wait for an instance of the pool
to become available.

After the timeout is reached, if an instance in the pool cannot be
obtained, the method invocation will fail.

Usable time units: nanoseconds, microsecons, milliseconds, seconds,
minutes, hours, days. Or any combination such as "1 hour and 27 minutes
and 10 seconds"

Any usage of the `javax.ejb.AccessTimeout` annotation will override this
setting for the bean or method where the annotation is used.

== callbackThreads

The number of threads for constructing and destroying beans.

When sweeping the pool for expired instances a thread pool is used to
process calling `@PreDestroy` on expired instances as well as creating
new instances as might be required to fill the pool to the minimum after
a Flush or `MaxAge` expiration. The `CallbackThreads` setting dictates
the size of the thread pool and is shared by all beans deployed in the
container.

== closeTimeout

Maximum time to wait for instances to be destroyed when shutting down
the pool

PostConstruct methods are invoked on all instances in the pool when the
bean is undeployed and its pool is closed. The `CloseTimeout` specifies
the maximum time to wait for the pool to close and `PostConstruct`
methods to be invoked.

Usable time units: nanoseconds, microsecons, milliseconds, seconds,
minutes, hours, days. Or any combination such as
`1 hour and 27 minutes and 10 seconds`

== garbageCollection

Allows Garbage Collection to be used as a mechanism for shrinking the
pool.

When set to true all instances in the pool, excluding the minimum, are
eligible for garbage collection by the virtual machine as per the rules
of `java.lang.ref.SoftReference` and can be claimed by the JVM to free
memory. Instances garbage collected will have their `@PreDestroy`
methods called during finalization.

In the OpenJDK VM the `-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB` flag can adjust how
aggressively SoftReferences are collected. The default OpenJDK setting
is 1000, resulting in inactive pooled instances living one second of
lifetime per free megabyte in the heap, which is very aggressive. The
setting should be increased to get the most out of the
`GarbageCollection` feature of the pool. Much higher settings are safe.
Even a setting as high as 3600000 (1 hour per free MB in the heap) does
not affect the ability for the VM to garbage collect SoftReferences in
the event that memory is needed to avoid an `OutOfMemoryException`.

== idleTimeout

Specifies the maximum time that an instance should be allowed to sit
idly in the pool without use before it should be retired and removed.

Only instances in surplus of the pool's `MinSize` are eligible to expire
via `IdleTimeout` Instances that expire due to `IdleTimeout` will have
their `@PreDestroy` methods invoked before being completely destroyed.

Usable time units: nanoseconds, microsecons, milliseconds, seconds,
minutes, hours, days. Or any combination such as "1 hour and 27 minutes
and 10 seconds"

== maxAge

Specifies the maximum time that an instance should live before it should
be retired and removed from use.

This will happen gracefully. Useful for situations where bean instances
are designed to hold potentially expensive resources such as memory or
file handles and need to be periodically cleared out.

Usable time units: nanoseconds, microsecons, milliseconds, seconds,
minutes, hours, days. Or any combination such as
`1 hour and 27 minutes and 10 seconds`

== maxAgeOffset

Applies to MaxAge usage and would rarely be changed, but is a nice
feature to understand.

When the container first starts and the pool is filled to the minimum
size, all those "minimum" instances will have the same creation time and
therefore all expire at the same time dictated by the `MaxAge` setting.
To protect against this sudden drop scenario and provide a more gradual
expiration from the start the container will spread out the age of the
instances that fill the pool to the minimum using an offset.

The `MaxAgeOffset` is not the final value of the offset, but rather it
is used in creating the offset and allows the spreading to push the
initial ages into the future or into the past. The pool is filled at
startup as follows:

....
for (int i = 0; i < poolMin; i++) {
    long ageOffset = (maxAge / poolMin * i * maxAgeOffset) % maxAge;
    pool.add(new Bean(), ageOffset));
}
....

The default `MaxAgeOffset` is -1 which causes the initial instances in
the pool to live a bit longer before expiring. As a concrete example,
let's say the MinSize is 4 and the MaxAge is 100 years. The generated
offsets for the four instances created at startup would be 0, -25, -50,
-75. So the first instance would be "born" at age 0, die at 100, living
100 years. The second instance would be born at -25, die at 100, living
a total of 125 years. The third would live 150 years. The fourth 175
years.

A `MaxAgeOffset` of 1 would cause instances to be "born" older and
therefore die sooner. Using the same example `MinSize` of 4 and `MaxAge`
of `100 years`, the life spans of these initial four instances would be
100, 75, 50, and 25 years respectively.

A `MaxAgeOffset` of 0 will cause no "spreading" of the age of the first
instances used to fill the pool to the minimum and these instances will
of course reach their MaxAge at the same time. It is possible to set to
decimal values such as -0.5, 0.5, -1.2, or 1.2.

== maxSize

Specifies the size of the instance pool for this stateless SessionBean
container.

Each `@Stateless` bean will get its own instance pool. If StrictPooling
is not used, instances will still be created beyond this number if there
is demand, but they will not be returned to the pool and instead will be
immediately expire.

== minSize

Specifies the minimum number of bean instances that should be in the
pool for each bean.

Pools are prefilled to the minimum on startup. Note this will create
start order dependencies between other beans that also eagerly start,
such as other `@Stateless` beans with a minimum or `@Singleton` beans
using `@Startup`. The `@DependsOn` annotation can be used to
appropriately influence start order.

The minimum pool size is rigidly maintained. Instances in the minimum
side of the pool are not eligible for `IdleTimeout` or
`GarbageCollection`, but are subject to `MaxAge` and flushing.

If the pool is flushed it is immediately refilled to the minimum size
with `MaxAgeOffset` applied. If an instance from the minimum side of the
pool reaches its `MaxAge`, it is also immediately replaced. Replacement
is done in a background queue using the number of threads specified by
`CallbackThreads`.

== replaceAged

When `ReplaceAged` is enabled, any instances in the pool that expire due
to reaching their `MaxAge` will be replaced immediately so that the pool
will remain at its current size.

Replacement is done in a background queue so that incoming threads will
not have to wait for instance creation.

The aim of his option is to prevent user requests from paying the
instance creation cost as `MaxAge` is enforced, potentially while under
heavy load at peak hours.

Instances from the minimum side of the pool are always replaced when
they reach their `MaxAge`, this setting dictates the treatment of
non-minimum instances.

== replaceFlushed

When `ReplaceFlushed` is enabled, any instances in the pool that are
flushed will be replaced immediately so that the pool will remain at its
current size.

Replacement is done in a background queue so that incoming threads will
not have to wait for instance creation.

The aim of his option is to prevent user requests from paying the
instance creation cost if a flush performed while under heavy load at
peak hours.

Instances from the minimum side of the pool are always replaced when
they are flushed, this setting dictates the treatment of non-minimum
instances.

A bean may flush its pool by casting the `SessionContext` to `Flushable`
and calling `flush()`. See `SweepInterval` for details on how flush is
performed.

....
import javax.annotation.Resource;
import javax.ejb.SessionContext;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import java.io.Flushable;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MyBean {

    private SessionContext sessionContext;

    public void flush() throws IOException {

        ((Flushable) sessionContext).flush();
    }
}
....

== strictPooling

StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool reaches it's
maximum size and there are incoming requests that need instances.

With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances to become
available. The pool size will never grow beyond the the set `MaxSize`
value. The maximum amount of time a request should wait is specified via
the `AccessTimeout` setting.

Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary instances to
meet demand. The instances will last for just one method invocation and
then are removed.

Setting `StrictPooling` to `false` and `MaxSize` to `0` will result in
no pooling. Instead instances will be created on demand and live for
exactly one method call before being removed.

== sweepInterval

The frequency in which the container will sweep the pool and evict
expired instances.

Eviction is how the `IdleTimeout`, `MaxAge`, and pool "flush"
functionality is enforced. Higher intervals are better.

Instances in use are excluded from sweeping. Should an instance expire
while in use it will be evicted immediately upon return to the pool.
Effectively `MaxAge` and flushes will be enforced as a part of normal
activity or sweeping, while IdleTimeout is only enforcable via sweeping.
This makes aggressive sweeping less important for a pool under moderate
load.

Usable time units: nanoseconds, microsecons, milliseconds, seconds,
minutes, hours, days. Or any combination such as
`1 hour and 27 minutes and 10 seconds`
