OpenEJB and TomEE services using ServicePool as wrapper - for instance
ejbd service or all services not implementing SelfManaging interface -
support some additional configuration due to the pooling. Here is the
list of the additional properties (either configure them in the service
configuration file in conf/conf.d/$\{service}.properties or in
conf/system.properties prefixing them by “\{service}.”).

Basically using ServicePool the service is associated to a
ThreadPoolExecutor and this one is configured with these properties (see
ThreadPoolExecutor constructor for the detail):

* threadsCore (default 10)
* threads (default 150)
* queue (default threadCore-1)
* block (default true)
* keepAliveTime (default 60000)

Additionally you can force the socket to be closed after each request
(this is an advanced setting, use it with caution):

* forceSocketClose (default true)
