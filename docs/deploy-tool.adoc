# NAME

openejb deploy - OpenEJB Deploy Tool

# SYNOPSIS

____________________________________________________________________
openejb deploy link:#DeployTool-OPTIONS[options] <file> [<file> ...]
____________________________________________________________________

# NOTE

The OpenEJB Deploy tool is an OPTIONAL tool that allows you to deploy
into a running server and get feedback as if the app was deployed and
how it was deployed (deploymentIds, jndi names, etc.).

It can be used to deploy into an offline server, however in this
scenario it simply copies the archive into the deployment directory (by
default `openejb.base/apps`) which is something that can be done
manually with a simple copy command or drag and drop.

The OpenEJB Deploy tool can be executed from any directory as long as
`openejb.home/bin` is in the system PATH. `openejb.home` is the
directory where OpenEJB was installed or unpacked. For for the remainder
of this document we will assume you unpacked OpenEJB into the directory
`C:\openejb-3.0` under Windows.

In Windows, the deploy tool can be executed as follows:

________________________
C:-3.0> bindeploy --help
________________________

In UNIX, Linux, or Mac OS X, the deploy tool can be executed as follows:

____________________________________
user@host# bin/openejb deploy --help
____________________________________

Depending on your OpenEJB version, you may need to change execution bits
to make the scripts executable. You can do this with the following
command.

_______________________________
user@host# chmod +x bin/openejb
_______________________________

From here on out, it will be assumed that you know how to execute the
right openejb script for your operating system and commands will appear
in shorthand as show below.

_____________________
openejb deploy --help

# DESCRIPTION

The files passed to the Deploy Tool can be any combination of the
following:

* EJB 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 jar
* application client jar
* EAR file containing only libraries, EJBs and application clients --
everything else will be ignored.

The type of the files passed is determined as follows:

* Archives ending in `.ear` or containing a `META-INF/application.xml`
are assumed to be EAR files.
* Archives containing a `META-INF/ejb-jar.xml` file or any classes
annotated with `@Stateless`, `@Stateful` or `@MessageDriven`, are
assumed to be _EJB_ applications. EJB applications older that EJB 3.0
should contain a complete `META-INF/ejb-jar.xml` inside the jar, however
we do not strictly enforce that -- the act of it being incomplete makes
it an EJB 3.0 application by nature.
* Archives containing a `META-INF/application-client.xml` or with a
`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` containing the `Main-Class` attribute, are
assumed to be _Application Client_ archives.

# OPTIONS

-d, --debug

Increases the level of detail on validation errors and deployment
summary.

--dir

Sets the destination directory where the app will be deployed. The
default is /apps/ directory. Note when changing this setting make sure
the directory is listed in the openejb.xml via a tag or the app will not
be picked up again on restart.

-conf file

Sets the OpenEJB configuration to the specified file.

-h, --help

Lists these options and exit.

-o, --offline

Deploys the app to an offline server by copying the archive into the
server's apps/ directory. The app will be deployed when the server is
started. The default is online.

-q, --quiet

Decreases the level of detail on validation and skips the deployment
summary.

-s, --server-url <url>

Sets the url of the OpenEJB server to which the app will be deployed.
The value should be the same as the JNDI Provider URL used to lookup
EJBs. The default is 'ejbd://localhost:4201'.

-v, --version

Prints the OpenEJB version and exits.

# EXAMPLES

== Deploying multiple jar files

__________________________________
openejb deploy myapp.jar myapp.jar
__________________________________

Deploys the beans in the fooEjbs.jar first, then deploys the beans in
the barEjbs.jar. Wildcards can be used as well.

_________________________
openejb deploy myapp*.jar
_________________________

# OUTPUT

On running the deploy tool with a valid EJB jar the following output is
printed on the console

....
Application deployed successfully at {0}
App(id=C:\samples\Calculator-new\hello-addservice.jar)
    EjbJar(id=hello-addservice.jar, path=C:\samples\Calculator-new\hello-addservice.jar)
    Ejb(ejb-name=HelloBean, id=HelloBean)
        Jndi(name=HelloBean)
        Jndi(name=HelloBeanLocal)

    Ejb(ejb-name=AddServiceBean, id=AddServiceBean)
        Jndi(name=AddServiceBean)
        Jndi(name=AddServiceBeanLocal)
....

Note: In the above case the command used is: > openejb deploy
hello-addservice.jar

The JAR file contains two EJBs: AddServiceBean and HelloBean.
