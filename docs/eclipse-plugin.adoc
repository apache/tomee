# What is it?

The _OpenEJB Eclipse Plugin_ will be a suite of tools made available via
Eclipse to make EJB development with OpenEJB easier. The initial
offering will probably provide basic functionality by taking advantage
of http://www.eclipse.org/webtools[WebTools] to allow for OpenEJB to be
an available container/runtime within Eclipse. This means full debugging
and Eclipse project integration. From there, the sky is the limit so
feel free to suggest features on the [OpenEJB Dev list|Mailing
Lists#MailingLists-DeveloperMailingList] .

# How to get involved?

Just the same as getting involved with any part of OpenEJB -- send a
mail to the
link:mailing-lists#mailinglists-developermailinglist.html[OpenEJB Dev
list] and say "Hi!" We're a very relaxed group so no need to be perfect
or overly prepared. Just dive right in, we're always happy to have more.

# Where do I get it?

The initiative is just launching, but you can grab what we have right
here and start hacking.
