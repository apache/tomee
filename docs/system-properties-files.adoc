== OpenEJB System Properties File

OpenEJB and TomEE are really configurable in particular through system
properties.

What is not so known is these system properties can be read from several
places. The order is important, it means if the second place provides
the same property than the first one, the first one will be omitted.

Here how it works:

* JVM system properties: -Dxxx=yyy
* user system.properties: the file
$\{user.home}/.openejb/system.properties
* instance system.properties: conf/system.properties

Note: generally you place in the user system properties file the contant
configuration (check my openejb version for instance).
