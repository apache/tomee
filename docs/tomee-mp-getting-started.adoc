###Add The TomEE Maven Plugin To An Existing Project

If you already have a maven project set up then just add the plugin as
described link:maven/index.html[here]

You will likely need the full Java EE API added to your pom file:

....
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.openejb</groupId>
  <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
  <version>6.0-6</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
....

The simplest path is to allow Maven to create an example project for
you. Even if you have an existing project you can always use the
template as a reference.

###Generate a Basic TomEE-Project With Maven

TomEE provides a maven-archetype for generating a template project. This
template project is preconfigured with `javaee-api` (scope provided) and
with the link:maven/index.html[`tomee-maven-plugin`] for starting the
application with TomEE.

For example, if current version of the archetype is '1.7.1', then the
required command to generate an application would be:

....
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.openejb.maven -DarchetypeArtifactId=tomee-webapp-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.7.1
....

The first time you run this command maven downloads the archetype and
some parts related to it. Afterwards you see a prompt which allows you
to specify the groupId, artifactId, version and package of your
application. If you are using 'tomee' as groupId, 'tomee-demo' as
artifactId, '1.0' as version and 'myapp' as package, your console should
show something like:

....
Define value for property 'groupId': : tomee     
Define value for property 'artifactId': : tomee-demo
Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: : 1.0
Define value for property 'package':  tomee: : myapp
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: tomee
artifactId: tomee-demo
version: 1.0
package: myapp
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
...
....

Afterwards you see a new folder with the name you used for the
artifactId (in the previous example 'tomee-demo'). For starting the
application you have to change the current directory to the directory of
the generated application:

....
cd tomee-demo
....

###Starting a TomEE-Project with Maven

With using the archetype everything you need is in place already. So you
just have to start TomEE with:

....
mvn package tomee:run
....

The first time you run this command takes a bit longer, because maven
has to download e.g. TomEE. Once those parts are downloaded, starting
maven, deploying and starting the generated application takes less than
10s (depending on your computer).

###Accessing a running application

The application gets deployed to `target/apache-tomee/webapps`. If
everything worked correctly, you should see a directory ('ROOT') as well
as a web-archive ('ROOT.war'). The context-paths of the deployed
application is ROOT. In our example the generated application contains a
servlet mapped to '/index'. So you can access it via:

....
http://localhost:8080/index
....
