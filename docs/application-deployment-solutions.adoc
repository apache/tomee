== Deploying An Application To TomEE Or OpenEJB

=== How to deploy my application under TomEE

==== Description

This aims to be more dynamic in the way you deploy your applications. It
is clearly cloud oriented.

==== Webapp and TomEE deployment

Webapp can be deployed as Tomcat does. Simply put it in webapps folder
(or the one you configured) and start TomEE.

==== TomEE specific deployment

By default TomEE deploys applications (ear, war, jar) contained in
$CATALINA_BASE/apps directory at start up.

==== Deployer

OpenEJB provides a Deployer EJB to do this task. It can be used in your
own software looking up remotely the "openejb/DeployerBusinessRemote"
EJB. Its interface is "org.apache.openejb.assembler.Deployer". The
needed dependency is org.apache.openejb:openejb-core.

Once you got your deployer simply invoke the "deploy" method. Give it
the location of your application (can be a file, http, https, maven
location depending on the way you configured your container, for more
information have a look to TomEE provisionning).

Note: the "undeploy" method exists too and take the same path.

The Deployer is the base of all other solutions

==== Maven plugin

link:maven/index.html[org.apache.openejb:tomee-maven-plugin] can be used
to deploy/undeploy your application. Once this plugin is added to your
pom you have access to the following configuration:

* tomeeHttpPort
* tomeeHost

Then simply run

....
mvn tomee:deploy <path>
....

or

....
mvn tomee:undeploy <path>
....

===== The Deployer through TomEE Webapp

When you start TomEE you can locally access the TomEE webapps
(http://host:ip/tomee/).

Then simply go to JNDI tree, select the deployer in the tree, then click
on "invoke this ejb", select the deploy (or undeploy) method, fill the
path and click on "invoke".

===== Cloud idea

If you want to cloudify your application, you'll get a configuration
database (or any other storage system ;)).

So it means it is easy for you to get a host and a port...so it is easy
to deploy on all your server using the deployer: simply use the maven
provisioning then run the deployer on all your nodes and that's all!

==== Doing it with camel?

If you are using a route to deploy/undeploy your applications you can
have a look to the proposed camel-openejb component:

* base code:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/sandbox/camel/camel-openejb/
* proposed to be added to camel:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-4935
