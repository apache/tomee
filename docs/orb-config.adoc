A ORB can be declared via xml in the `<tomee-home>/conf/tomee.xml` file
or in a `WEB-INF/resources.xml` file using a declaration like the
following. All properties in the element body are optional.

....
<Resource id="myORB" type="org.omg.CORBA.ORB">
</Resource>
....

Alternatively, a ORB can be declared via properties in the
`<tomee-home>/conf/system.properties` file or via Java VirtualMachine
`-D` properties. The properties can also be used when embedding TomEE
via the `javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer` API or `InitialContext`

....
myORB = new://Resource?type=org.omg.CORBA.ORB
....

Properties and xml can be mixed. Properties will override the xml
allowing for easy configuration change without the need for $\{} style
variable substitution. Properties are not case sensitive. If a property
is specified that is not supported by the declared ORB a warning will be
logged. If a ORB is needed by the application and one is not declared,
TomEE will create one dynamically using default settings. Multiple ORB
declarations are allowed. # Supported Properties
