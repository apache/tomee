. # TomEE
versioning policies

TomEE version policy is made of three dot-separated numbers: x.y.z

* x is the major version. It corresponds to the maximum Java EE
specification supported by TomEE and a codebase generation, starting
with value 1 for Java EE 6 support. Next major will be 7 targetting
JavaEE 7 etc...
* y is the minor version. It corresponds to a features level, starting
at 0. Initial TomEE release was 1.0.0, followed by 1.5.0 because of the
accumulation of features changes delivered since 1.0.0. Note that
features changes must comply with the Java EE specification level given
by TomEE's major version.
* z is the fix level. It corresponds to bug fixes changes without new
features, starting at 0. Upgrades of embedded components (Tomcat,
OpenEJB, MyFaces, etc.) are normally part of bug fixes releases.

These policies allow an Java EE application to be certified with a given
TomEEE version x.y.z and to be compatible with TomEE versions x.y1.*
with y1>y and compatible with TomEE version x.y.z1 with z1>z.

Important: being JavaEE certified means the server passed the Test
Compatibility Kit (TCK). To simplify/summarize it is a big test suite to
validate your are compliant with a JavaEE version. TomEE 1.x passed the
JavaEE 6 TCK which was donated to Apache Software Foundation by Oracle.
This donation hasn't been done to Apache for JavaEE 7 so TomEE is not
able for now to be validated against it and therefore TomEE versions
targetting JavaEE 7 are not yet certified.

To make it more explicit here is a small table showing the targetted
JavaEE version and the related certification state by version:
