_The TomcatEjbFactory as discussed in the
http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/02/12/ejb_tomcat.html[OnJava
article "OpenEJB: EJB for Tomcat"] is no longer required._

As of OpenEJB 3.0 references from Servlets to EJBs happen automatically
with usage of the [`@EJB`

See the openejbx30:tomcat.html[Tomcat Integration] page for the most
