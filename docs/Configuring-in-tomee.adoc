###Configuring Resources:

* Drivers are dropped into tomeeDir/lib
* Resources are configured in tomeeDir/conf/tomee.xml. +
* The configurations take a very simple (XML+Property-file) syntax.
* Tag names match annotation names

For example,

....
@Resource DataSource moviesDatabase 
....

is injected with the following resource:

....
<Resource id="moviesDatabase" type="DataSource">    
JdbcDriver org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver    
JdbcUrl jdbc:mysql:localhost:3306/moviesdb    
UserName sa    
Password secret    
JtaManaged true    
</Resource>
....
