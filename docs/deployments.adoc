# The 'Deployments' element in openejb.xml

== A single jar

To include a single jar by name, just declare a 'Deployments' element
with a 'jar' attribute pointing to the jar file on the file system.

....
<openejb>
...
<Deployments jar="c:\my\app\superEjbs.jar" />
<Deployments jar="c:\someplace\purchasing.jar" />
<Deployments jar="timeTrack.jar" />
</openejb>
....

The last element in the example uses a relative path to point to the ejb
jar. This path will be resolved relative to the openejb.base property.
So, for example, of the value of openejb.base was 'c:' then OpenEJB
would look for the jar 'c:.jar'. See the [OPENEJB:Configuration] guide
for more details.

== A directory of jars

To point to a directory that contains several jar files that OpenEJB
should load, simply declare a 'Deployments' element with a 'dir'
attribute pointing to the directory containing the jar files.

....
<openejb>
...

<Deployments dir="c:\my\app\beans\" />
<Deployments dir="c:\crimestopper\lib" />
<Deployments dir="ejbs" />
<Deployments dir="beans" />
</openejb>
....

The directories listed will be searched for jars containing
'META-INF/ejb-jar.xml' files and will be added to the list of jars to
load if they do. Better said, it's completely safe to point to a
directory containing a mix of ejbs and regular jar files. OpenEJB will
simply skip over jars that do contain the required
'META-INF/ejb-jar.xml' file.

The last Deployments element declares a 'beans' directory relative to
openejb.base for holding ejb jars. This declaration is simply convention
and not required.

== An unpacked jar

As of 1.0 beta1, OpenEJB supports unpacked ejb jars. Simply meaning that
you don't need to pack your ejb's into a jar file in order to use them
in OpenEJB. You still need to follow the ejb jar layout and include an
"META-INF/ejb-jar.xml" in the directory that contains your ejbs.

For example, if you have a directory structure like this:

....
> C:\myapp\
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\META-INF\ejb-jar.xml
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\org\acme\Foo.class
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\org\acme\FooBean.class
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\org\acme\FooHome.class
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\org\acme\Bar.class
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\org\acme\BarBean.class
> C:\myapp\acmeEjbs\org\acme\BarHome.class
....

Then you would delcare a 'Deployments' element with the 'dir' attribute
set to 'C:' as shown below.

....
<openejb>
...

<Deployments dir="c:\myapp\acmeEjbs" />
</openejb>
....

Note that this syntax is the same as the directory syntax above. If
OpenEJB finds a META-INF directory with an 'ejb-jar.xml' fine inside,
then OpenEJB will treat the directory as an unpacked ejb jar. Otherwise
OpenEJB will look for ejb jar files to load as detailed in the above
section.

== Log file

When trying to figure out if your ejbs were loaded, the openejb.log file
is an incredible asset.

If your ejbs were loaded successfully you should see entries like the
following (1.x and higher only):

....
INFO :  Loaded EJBs from
/usr/local/openejb-1.0-beta1/beans/openejb-itests-beans.jar
INFO :  Loaded EJBs from
/usr/local/openejb-1.0-beta1/beans/openejb-webadmin-clienttools.jar
....

If your ejbs failed to load, you will see an entry similar to the
following.

....
WARN :  Jar not loaded. /usr/local/openejb-1.0-beta1/beans/helloworld.jar.
Jar failed validation.  Use the validation tool for more details
....

Additionally, all the successfully loaded ejbs are individually listed
in the log file at startup. The Deployment ID listed is the JNDI name
used to lookup the ejb from a client of the Local or Remote Servers. The
beans listed below are from our test suite.
