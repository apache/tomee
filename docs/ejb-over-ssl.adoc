It is possible to setup client/server requests over SSL. EJB requests
from a remote client can happen two different ways:

* *https* for when an EJB is running in TomEE
* *ejbds* for when an EJB is running in OpenEJB Standalone

Note, TomEE can be setup to support *ejbds*.

== https

First, you'll need to setup Tomcat (TomEE) with SSL as described here:

http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html

Once that is done and the `tomee` webapp can be accessed with `https`,
an EJB client can invoke over `https` using the following
`InitialContext` setup:

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put("java.naming.factory.initial", "org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put("java.naming.provider.url", "https://127.0.0.1:8443/tomee/ejb");
// user and pass optional
p.put("java.naming.security.principal", "myuser");
p.put("java.naming.security.credentials", "mypass");

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext(p);

MyBean myBean = (MyBean) ctx.lookup("MyBeanRemote");
....

If you setup Tomcat (TomEE) to use the APR (Apache Portable Runitme)
implementation of SSL on the server side, and you have connection issues
like connection reset, you'll have to set 'https.protocols' system
property. 'https.protocols' property must be set according to the
SSLProtocol parameter of the HTTPS connector configuration :

http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html

You can also have a look a this :

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/plugin/developer_guide/faq/troubleshooting.html

== ejbds

The SSL version of the `ejbd` protocol is called `ejbds` and is enabled
and setup in OpenEJB Standalone by default.

Its configuration `conf/ejbds.properties` looks like this:

....
server      = org.apache.openejb.server.ejbd.EjbServer
bind        = 127.0.0.1
port        = 4203
disabled    = false
threads     = 200
backlog     = 200
secure      = true
discovery   = ejb:ejbds://{bind}:{port}
....

To access this service from a remote client, the `InitialContext` would
be setup like the following:

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put("java.naming.factory.initial", "org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put("java.naming.provider.url", "ejbd://localhost:4201");
// user and pass optional
p.put("java.naming.security.principal", "myuser");
p.put("java.naming.security.credentials", "mypass");

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext(p);

MyBean myBean = (MyBean) ctx.lookup("MyBeanRemote");
....

=== Changing the Cipher Suite

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENEJB-1856[This is a pending
feature] By default, the ejbds protocol connects with
SSL_DH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_MD5. That means your connection is encrypted
and the integrity of the transmission is verified. However, this only
protects your from eavesdroppers, it offers absolutely zero protection
from Man in the Middle attacks. This sort of attack could be pulled off
without your knowledge and the attacker has the ability to intercept,
monitor, and even modify your messages. If the attacker could control a
router on your connection path, this attack could be trivially pulled
off with nothing more but the OpenEJB server and client.

To secure your connections against this sort of attack, your client can
cryptographically prove it's talking to the correct server before
sending any data. To do this, simply select one or more secure cipher
suites that your J2SE provider supports from
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19728-01/820-2550/cipher_suites.html[this
listing].

You must now instruct the client and server to use that suite.

On the server:

....
server      = org.apache.openejb.server.ejbd.EjbServer
bind        = 127.0.0.1
port        = 4203
disabled    = false
threads     = 200
backlog     = 200
secure      = true
enabledCipherSuites = TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
discovery   = ejb:ejbds://{bind}:{port}
....

On the client, you must supply a property:

....
-Dopenejb.client.enabledCipherSuites=TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
....

The final piece is to make sure your server has available a private
certificate that the the client can trust. This can be certificate from
an authority or a self signed certificate. The javax.net.ssl.trustStore
and javax.net.ssl.keyStore JVM properties
http://fusesource.com/docs/broker/5.3/security/SSL-SysProps.html[are
used to set this up.]
