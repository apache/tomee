<a name="CommonErrors-Cannotfindcontainer"FOO"forbean"BAR""> # Cannot
find container "FOO" for bean "BAR"

When a bean gets deployed in OpenEJB, it gets associated with a
particular container. Subsequently, that container may not be configured
in that instance of the server. When the server loads the Jar with the
deployed beans, it places beans in the containers that the beans were
configured with. Here, the bean BAR wants to go into the container FOO,
which is not currently configured.

This message is displayed when the server is starting up. <a
name="CommonErrors-Cannotfindbean"FOO"referencedbybean"BAR"."> # Cannot
find bean "FOO" referenced by bean "BAR".

When a bean gets deployed in OpenEJB, it may contain references to other
beans. Subsequently, those beans may not be configured in that instance
of the server. When the server loads the Jar with the deployed beans, it
stores those references to those beans. Here, the bean BAR references
FOO, which is not currently configured in the JNDI namespace.

This message is displayed when the server is starting up.

This message is usally the result of a deployment descriptor that has
been created by hand.
