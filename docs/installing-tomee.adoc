== Downloading a Distribution Archive

Download a distribution archive of the latest TomEE release from the
link:downloads.html[Downloads] page. If you are not sure which one to
use, take apache-tomee-webprofile-x.y.z.zip.

If you want to try out the latest development snapshot (e.g. to test a
bugfix which has not yet been released), then download an archive
directly from the
https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/openejb/apache-tomee[Apache
Maven Snapshots Repository] instead.

The instructions on this page work with the webprofile distribution but
apply to all TomEE distributions (webprofile, jaxrs or plus). If you
work with the jaxrs or plus distribution, simply replace the name where
appropriate.

== Unpacking the Archive

Unpack the archive in any directory. The top-level directory of the
unpacked archive is called apache-tomee-webprofile-x.y.z/. We refer to
this directory as $CATALINA_HOME in the following.

== Prerequisites for Running TomEE

* A Java 6 or 7 runtime environment is in your PATH.
* TCP ports 8080, 8005 and 8009 are free.

== Starting TomEE

To start TomEE as a background process, invoke

....
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh
....

To start TomEE in foreground, invoke

....
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh run
....

== Log Messages

When running TomEE in foreground, it will print all log messages to the
console.

When running TomEE in background, it will only print a couple of
environment variables. The log messages go to a file

....
$CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out
....

== Stopping TomEE

To stop TomEE, invoke

....
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
....

If you started TomEE in foreground via `catalina.sh run`, it is safe to
simply type `Ctrl-C`.
