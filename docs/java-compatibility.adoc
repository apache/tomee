TomEE 8.0.0-M3 is Java EE 8 only. Any OS that supports Java 8 works


*Note*:

. Please note the `8.0.0-M3` release is a milestone release intended for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production
. As of now TomEE `8.0.0-M3` is not fully compatible with `Java 11`. `Java 11` will be compatible if all issues are resolved and pass all tests
