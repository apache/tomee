Like Resources, Containers
can also be declared via InitialContext properties as well. The most
useful is to declare a Stateful SessionBean container so that it's
guaranteed to passivate and activate on each call to the bean, allowing
you to test your callbacks behave as you need them to.

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.apache.openejb.core.LocalInitialContextFactory");

p.put("myStatefulContainer", "new://Container?type=STATEFUL");
p.put("myStatefulContainer.PoolSize", "0");
p.put("myStatefulContainer.BulkPassivate", "1");

Context context = new InitialContext(p);
....

Note, this only works when using the LocalInitialContextFactory to embed
OpenEJB into the vm. Once embedded, further configuration properties are
ignored.

See link:containers-and-resources.html[Containers and Resources] for a
full list of supported Resource types and their properties.
