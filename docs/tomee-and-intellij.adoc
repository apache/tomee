Intellij is the preferred editor of most of the developers on Apache
TomEE. It's fast and light and goes out of its way to guess what you're
thinking and act accordingly in efforts to save you time and increase
your enjoyment. In this regard TomEE and Intellij have a lot in common.

While TomEE works with most IDEs via the Tomcat adapter and this covers
WAR files, JetBrains has stepped up to the plate with a TomEE specific
adapter to allow deployment of the full range of archives that TomEE
supports. The evolving TomEE/Intellij integration sets the pace for all
other IDE integrations.

welcome!] TomEE is to Intellij what GlassFish is to NetBeans and your
feedback is a critcal part of that.
