OpenEJB supports stateless failover. Specifically, the ability for an
EJB client to failover from one server to the next if a request cannot
be completed. No application state information is communicated between
the servers, so this functionality should be used only with applications
that are inherently stateless. A common term for this sort of setup is a
server farm.

The basic design assumption is that all servers in the same group have
the same applications deployed and are capable of doing the same job.
Servers can be brought online and offline while clients are running. As
members join/leave this information is sent to the client as part of
normal EJB request/response communication so active clients always have
the most current information on servers that can process their request
should communication with a particular server fail.

== Client Behavior

On each request to the server, the client will send the version number
associated with the list of servers in the cluster it is aware of.
Initially this version will be zero and the list will be empty. Only
when the server sees the client has an old list will the server send the
updated list. This is an important distinction as the list is not
transmitted back and forth on every request, only on change. If the
membership of the cluster is stable there is essentially no clustering
overhead to the protocol -- 8 byte overhead to each request and 1 byte
on each response -- so you will _not_ see an exponential slowdown in
response times the more members are added to the cluster. This new list
takes affect for all proxies that share the same connection.

When a server shuts down, more connections are refused, existing
connections not in mid-request are closed, any remaining connections are
closed immediately after completion of the request in progress and
clients can failover gracefully to the next server in the list. If a
server crashes requests are retried on the next server in the list (or
depending on the `ConnectionStrategy`). This failover pattern is
followed until there are no more servers in the list at which point the
client attempts a final multicast search (if it was created with a
`PROVIDER_URL` starting with `multicast://`) before abandoning the
request and throwing an exception to the caller.

By default, the failover is ordered but random selection is supported.
The multicast discovery aspect of the client adds a nice randomness to
the selection of the first server.

== Discovery

Each discoverable service has a URI which is broadcast as a heartbeat to
other servers in the cluster. This URI advertises the service's type,
its cluster group, and its location in the format of
'group:jbake-date: 2018-12-05
:jbake-type:location'. Say for example
"cluster1:ejb:ejbd://thehost:4201". The URI is sent out repeatedly in a
pulse and its presence on the network indicates its availability and its
absence indicates the service is no longer available.

The sending of this pulse (the heartbeat) can be done via UDP or TCP:
multicast and "multipoint" respectively. More on that in the following
section. The rate at which the heartbeat is pulsed to the network can be
specified via the 'heart_rate' property. The default is 500
milliseconds. This rate is also used when listening for services on the
network. If a service goes missing for the duration of 'heart_rate'
multiplied by 'max_missed_heartbeats', then the service is considered
dead.

The 'group' property, cluster1 in the example, is used to dissect the
servers on the network into smaller logical clusters. A given server
will broadcast all it's services with the group prefixed in the URI, as
well it will ignore any services it sees broadcast if they do not share
the same group name.
