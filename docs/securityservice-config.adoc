A SecurityService can be declared via xml in the
`<tomee-home>/conf/tomee.xml` file or in a `WEB-INF/resources.xml` file
using a declaration like the following. All properties in the element
body are optional.

....
<SecurityService id="mySecurityService" type="SecurityService">
    defaultUser = guest         
</SecurityService>
....

Alternatively, a SecurityService can be declared via properties in the
`<tomee-home>/conf/system.properties` file or via Java VirtualMachine
`-D` properties. The properties can also be used when embedding TomEE
via the `javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer` API or `InitialContext`

....
mySecurityService = new://SecurityService?type=SecurityService
mySecurityService.defaultUser = guest         
....

Properties and xml can be mixed. Properties will override the xml
allowing for easy configuration change without the need for $\{} style
variable substitution. Properties are not case sensitive. If a property
is specified that is not supported by the declared SecurityService a
warning will be logged. If a SecurityService is needed by the
application and one is not declared, TomEE will create one dynamically
using default settings. Multiple SecurityService declarations are
allowed. # Supported Properties
