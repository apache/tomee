A Topic can be declared via xml in the `<tomee-home>/conf/tomee.xml`
file or in a `WEB-INF/resources.xml` file using a declaration like the
following. All properties in the element body are optional.

....
<Resource id="myTopic" type="javax.jms.Topic">
    destination = 
</Resource>
....

Alternatively, a Topic can be declared via properties in the
`<tomee-home>/conf/system.properties` file or via Java VirtualMachine
`-D` properties. The properties can also be used when embedding TomEE
via the `javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer` API or `InitialContext`

....
myTopic = new://Resource?type=javax.jms.Topic
myTopic.destination = 
....

Properties and xml can be mixed. Properties will override the xml
allowing for easy configuration change without the need for $\{} style
variable substitution. Properties are not case sensitive. If a property
is specified that is not supported by the declared Topic a warning will
be logged. If a Topic is needed by the application and one is not
declared, TomEE will create one dynamically using default settings.
Multiple Topic declarations are allowed. # Supported Properties
