MultiPulse is an alternative multicast lookup that does not use a
regular heartbeat. Instead, servers listen for a multicast request
packet (a pulse) to which a response is then sent. Multicast network
traffic is effectively reduced to an absolute minimum.

MultiPulse is only useful in network scenarios where both client and
server can be configured to send multicast UDP packets.

== Server Configuration

After you boot the server for the first time the default configuration
will create the file `conf/conf.d/multipulse.properties` containing:

....
server      = org.apache.openejb.server.discovery.MulticastPulseAgent
bind        = 239.255.2.3
port        = 6142
disabled    = true
group       = default
....

You just need to enable the agent by setting `disabled = false`. It is
advisable to disable multicast in the `multicast.properties file`, or at
least to use a different bind address or port should you wish to use
both.

All of the above settings except `server` can be modified as required.
The `port` and `bind` must be valid for general multicast/udp network
communication.

The `group` setting can be changed to further group/cluster servers that
may use the same multicast channel. As shown below the client also has
an optional `group` setting which can be used to select an appropriate
server cluster from the multicast channel (See MultiPulse Client).

The next step is to ensure that the advertised services are configured
for discovery. Edit the `ejbd.properties` file (and any other enabled
services such as http, etc.) and ensure that the `discovery` option is
set to a value that remote clients will be able to resolve.

....
server      = org.apache.openejb.server.ejbd.EjbServer
bind        = 0.0.0.0
port        = 4201
disabled    = false
threads     = 20
discovery   = ejb:ejbd://{bind}:{port}
....

NOTE: If either `0.0.0.0` (IPv4) or `[::]` (IPv6) wildcard bind
addresses are used then the server will actually broadcast all of it's
known public hosts to clients. Clients will then cycle though and
attempt to connect to the provided hosts until successful.

If `localhost` is used then only clients on the same physical machine
will actually 'see' the server response.

== MultiPulse Client

The multipulse functionality is not just for servers to find each other
in a cluster, it can also be used for EJB clients to discover a server.
A special `multipulse://` URL can be used in the `InitialContext`
properties to signify that multipulse should be used to seed the
connection process. Such as:

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "multipulse://239.255.2.3:6142?group=default&timeout=250");
InitialContext remoteContext = new InitialContext(p);
....

The URL has optional query parameters such as `schemes` and `group` and
`timeout` which allow you to zero in on a particular type of service of
a particular cluster group as well as set how long you are willing to
wait in the discovery process till finally giving up. The first matching
service that it sees "flowing" around on the UDP stream is the one it
picks and sticks to for that and subsequent requests, ensuring UDP is
only used when there are no other servers to talk to.

Note that EJB clients do not need to use multipulse to find a server. If
the client knows the URL of a server in the cluster, it may use it and
connect directly to that server, at which point that server will share
the full list of its peers.

== Multicast Servers with TCP Clients

Note that clients do not need to use multipulse to communicate with
servers. Servers can use multicast to discover each other, but clients
are still free to connect to servers in the network using the server's
TCP address.

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,  "org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "ejbd://192.168.1.30:4201");
InitialContext remoteContext = new InitialContext(p);
....

When the client connects, the server will send the URLs of all the
servers in the group and failover will take place normally.
