###Installing
TomEE as a WindowsÂ® Service

The different architecture exe's are as follows (so always use the one
that matches your system):

TomEE.amd64.exe = 64bit OS TomEE.ia64.exe = Itanium OS TomEE.x86.exe =
32bit OS

The only difference to Tomcat is that they ship with 'like named'
binaries, but in sub-directories - Or offer separate downloads for your
OS. We just modified the batch files to detect your arch-type and use
the correct binaries. Everything is all in the 'bin' directory so we
only have a one zip fits all approach.
