# OpenEJB JSR-107 (JCACHE) Integration

This page is for the collaboration for those involved with the
integration of JSR-107 into OpenEJB.

=== Overview

The idea here is to add a caching layer to OpenEJB. The overall
objective is to improve performance in OpenEJB where applicable through
caching EJBs.

=== Status

Dain and myself (Jeremy) have deciphered the JSR-107 spec and how I am
working on the first crude integration of JCACHE into OpenEJB. Anyone
interested in helping or providing any feedback/suggestions, please
contact me via the developer mailing list.
