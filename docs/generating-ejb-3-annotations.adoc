# Generating EJB 3 annotations

The OpenEJB Eclipse plugin is able to provide some assistance in helping
you migrate EJB 2.x projects to EJB 3.0, by analyzing your ejb-jar.xml
file, and adding EJB annotations to your source code. This page will
show you how to use this functionality.

First of all you will need to add the EJB 3.0 API jars to the classpath
of your project. If you are using Maven, you can add the following to
your POM (you will need to update your Eclipse project using mvn
eclipse:eclipse afterwards)

....
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.openejb</groupId>
      <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
      <version>5.0-1</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
....

Alternatively, import the API jars into your project, and add them to
your build path.

Next, click the 'OpenEJB' menu on the menubar, and select 'Generate
Annotations'.

selected. Click 'Next'.

Select your ejb-jar.xml and (optionally) your openejb-jar.xml files.
Select or deselect the other options as appropriate, and select 'Next'.

Options:

....
* Alter SessionBean interfaces - This option makes your session beans
....

implement your remote / local interfaces as opposed to
javax.ejb.SessionBean, and stops your remote / local interfaces
extending javax.ejb.EJBObject. * Add @Remote and @RemoteHome annotations
- This adds @Remote and @RemoteHome annotations appropriately * Convert
entity beans to POJOs - This options converts abstract CMP classes to
POJOs generating simple getters and setters.
