If you have an application that uses jersey-client in any way then it
may fail with an error along the lines of:

....
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.jersey.core.util.FeaturesAndProperties
at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java)
at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java)
at org.apache.tomee.catalina.LazyStopWebappClassLoader.loadClass(LazyStopWebappClassLoader.java)
... 34 more
....

This is due to the fact that the jersey-core.jar contains some classes
that should not be deployed as part of a javaEE application. For
example, it contains javax.ws.rs.Path but does not contain
javax.ws.rs.core.Configurable, so the jar is usually ignored by TomEE.

You could switch to using the http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF Client],
which is what we would recommend. If you really want to keep Jersey then
you can use set the following property in your _[TomEE].properties_

....
openejb.api.javax.ws.rs.Path.validation=false
....

This will then allow Jersey classes to be loaded by TomEE (After a
restart).
