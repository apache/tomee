There are two forms of the `tomee` webapp to consider:

* from an *tomee-1.x.x.war* that has been downloaded and added to a
Tomcat 7 install. This `tomee` webapp will contain all the necessary
libraries to add the missing Java EE functionality to Tomcat as well as
a small console.
* from an *apache-tomee-1.x.x.zip*. The `tomee` webapp shipped inside a
TomEE zip or tar is the same webapp as above, but with the libraries
moved into the `<tomcat-home>/lib/` directory

The only real difference between a "Tomcat with drop-in tomee.war" and a
"TomEE" install is where the additional libraries live.

== Deleting from plain Tomcat

Deleting the `tomee` webapp from a plain Tomcat install will effectively
uninstall TomEE from Tomcat.

== Deleting from TomEE

Deleting the `tomee` webapp from a TomEE install is safe as the needed
libraries have been moved into `<tomcat-home>/lib/`

The only loss of functionality would be the ability to remotely execute
EJBs over HTTP. However this can easily be added to a different webapp
like so:

....
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>ServerServlet</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>org.apache.openejb.server.httpd.ServerServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
 
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>ServerServlet</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/myejbs/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
....

Then you can create an `InitialContext` that points to that webapp like
so:

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put("java.naming.factory.initial", "org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put("java.naming.provider.url", "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mywebapp/myejbs");
// user and pass optional
p.put("java.naming.security.principal", "myuser");
p.put("java.naming.security.credentials", "mypass");

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext(p);

MyBean myBean = (MyBean) ctx.lookup("MyBeanRemote");
....
