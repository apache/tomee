The _@LocalClient_ annotation (org.apache.openejb.api.LocalClient) is an
innovation that crosses concepts of an Java EE Application Client with a
plain Java SE client. This particular annotation is focused on clients
of an Embeddable EJB container, i.e. local clients. There is another
annotation in development called @RemoteClient that will be focused on
remote clients; clients running outside the vm the container runs.

Any clients annotated with @LocalClient will be scanned at deployment
time for usage of injection-related annotations. The references in the
@LocalClient will be processed with the application just as if the class
was a Java EE Application Client module, but with a few slight
differences:

[arabic]
. Declaring field/method injection points as 'static' is not required
. References to EntityManagers via @PersistenceContext are allowed
. References to local business interfaces via @EJB is allowed
. References to UserTransaction via @Resource is allowed

As well since this is not a heavyweight Java EE Application Client, you
are not required to use any special packaging or command-line parameters
to run the client. Your client can be a Unit Test or any plain java code
that needs to pull objects from the Embedded EJB container. Classes with
@LocalClient can be placed in a Client module or an EJB module. A given
module may have as many classes annotated with @LocalClient as it
wishes.

# Injection

The injection occurs via acquiring a LocalInitialContext via the
LocalInitialContextFactory and calling _bind("inject", instance)_
passing in the instantiated local client object:

....
@LocalClient
public class MoviesTest extends TestCase {

    @EJB
    private Movies movies;

    @Resource
    private UserTransaction userTransaction;

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    public void setUp() throws Exception {
    Properties p = new Properties();
    p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.apache.openejb.client.LocalInitialContextFactory");
    InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext(p);
    initialContext.bind("inject", this);
    }

    //... other test methods
}
....

# Discovery

All EJB modules are scanned for @LocalClient classes, even if those EJB
Modules are inside .war files as with the
link:collapsed-ear.html[Collapsed EAR] . As well any modules that
contain a META-INF/application-client.xml file will be scanned for
@LocalClient classes.

If you see the following error message and are absolutely sure the
module containing your @LocalClient class is being properly identified
as an EJB module or a Client module, than it is possible you are seeing
some classloading issues.

\{panel} javax.naming.NamingException: Unable to find injection
meta-data for org.superbiz.MyClient. Ensure that class was annotated
with @org.apache.openejb.api.LocalClient and was successfully discovered
and deployed. \{panel}

If you encounter this try setting this openejb-specific boot flag so
that annotations will be treated specially and always loaded by the
parent classloader

`openejb.tempclassloader.skip=annotations`
