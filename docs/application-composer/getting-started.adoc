== Application Composer Getting Started

ApplicationComposer API is mainly contained in
`org.apache.openejb.testing` package (historically, today we would have
called the package `org.apache.tomee.applicationcomposer`).

=== Dependencies

To start using ApplicationComposer you need to add some dependencies.

The minimum required one is `openejb-core`:

....
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.openejb</groupId>
  <artifactId>openejb-core</artifactId>
  <version>${openejb.version></version>
</dependency>
....

If you need JAXRS services you'll add (or replace thanks to transitivity
of maven) `openejb-cxf-rs`:

....
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.openejb</groupId>
  <artifactId>openejb-cxf-rs</artifactId>
  <version>${openejb.version></version>
</dependency>
....

If you need JAXWS services you'll add (or replace thanks to transitivity
of maven) `openejb-cxf`:

....
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.openejb</groupId>
  <artifactId>openejb-cxf</artifactId>
  <version>${openejb.version></version>
</dependency>
....

etc...

=== ApplicationComposer Components

==== @Module

An ApplicationComposer needs at minimum a module (the application you
need to deploy).

To do so you have two cases:

* before TomEE 2.x: you can only write method(s) decorated with
`@Module`
* since TomEE 2.x: you can skip it and use `@Classes` directly on the
ApplicationComposer class as a shortcut for:
+
@Module public WebApp app() \{ return new WebApp(); }

The expected returned type of these methods are in
`org.apache.openejb.jee` package:

* `Application`: entry point to create an ear
* `WebApp`: a web application
* `EjbJar`: an ejb module
* `EnterpriseBean` children: a simple EJB
* `Persistence`: a persistence module with multiple units
* `PersistenceUnit`: a simple unit (automatically wrapped in a
`Persistence`)
* `Connector`: a JCA connector module
* `Beans`: a CDI module,
* `Class[]` or `Class`: a set of classes scanned to discover annotations

Note that for easiness `@Classes` was added to be able to describe a
module and some scanned classes. For instance the following snippet will
create a web application with classes C1, C2 as CDI beans and E1 as an
EJB automatically:

....
@Module
@Classes(cdi = true, value = { C1.class, C2.class, E1.class })
public WebApp app() {
    return new WebApp();
}
....

==== @Configuration

Often you need to customize a bit the container or at least create some
resources like test databases. To do so you can create a method
returning `Properties` which will be the container properties.

Note: to simplify writing properties you can use `PropertiesBuilder`
util class which is just a fluent API to write properties.

In these properties you can reuse OpenEJB/TomEE property syntax for
resources.

Here is a sample:

....
@Configuration
public Properties configuration() {
    return new PropertiesBuilder()
        .p("db", "new://Resource?type=DataSource")
        .p("db.JdbcUrld", "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test")
        .build();
}
....

Since TomEE 2.x you can also put properties on ApplicationComposer class
using `@ContainerProperties` API:

....
@ContainerProperties({
  @ContainerProperties.Property(name = "db", value = "new://Resource?type=DataSource"),
  @ContainerProperties.Property(name = "db.JdbcUrl", value = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test")
})
public class MyAppComposer() {
  // ...
}
....

==== @Component

Sometimes you need to customize a container component. The most common
use case is the security service to mock a little bit authorization if
you don't care in your test.

To do so just write a method decorated with `@Component` returning the
instance you desire.

Components in TomEE are stored in a container Map and the key needs to
be a `Class`. This one is deduced from the returned type of the
`@Component` method:

....
@Component
public SecurityService mockSecurity() {
    return new MySecurityService();
}
....

=== How to run it?

==== JUnit

If you use JUnit you have mainly 2 solutions to run you "model" using
the ApplicationComposer:

* using `ApplicationComposer` runner:
+
@RunWith(ApplicationComposer.class) public class MyTest \{ // ... }
* using `ApplicationComposerRule` rule:
+
public class MyTest \{ @Rule // or @ClassRule if you want the
container/application lifecycle be bound to the class and not test
methods public final ApplicationComposerRule rule = new
ApplicationComposerRule(this); }

Tip: since TomEE 2.x ApplicationComposerRule is decomposed in 2 rules if
you need: `ContainerRule` and `DeployApplication`. Using JUnit
`RuleChain` you can chain them to get the samebehavior as
`ApplicationComposerRule` or better deploy multiple ApplicationComposer
models and controlling their deployment ordering (to mock a remote
service for instance).

Finally just write `@Test` method using test class injections as if the
test class was a managed bean!

==== TestNG

TestNG integration is quite simple today and mainly
`ApplicationComposerListener` class you can configure as a listener to
get ApplicationComposer features.

Finally just write TestNG `@Test` method using test class injections as
if the test class was a managed bean!

==== Standalone

Since TomEE 2.x you can also use `ApplicationComposers` to directly run
you ApplicationComposer model as a standalone application:

....
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationComposers.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }

    // @Module, @Configuration etc...
}
....

Tip: if `MyApp` has `@PostConstruct` methods they will be respected and
if `MyApp` has a constructor taking an array of String it will be
instantiated getting the second parameter as argument (ie you can
propagate your main parameter to your model to modify your application
depending it!)

=== JUnit Sample

....
@Classes(cdi = true, value = { MyService.class, MyOtherService.class })
@ContainerProperties(@ContainerProperties.Property(name = "myDb", value = "new://Resource?type=DataSource"))
@RunWith(ApplicationComposer.class)
public class MyTest {
    @Resource(name = "myDb")
    private DataSource ds;

    @Inject
    private MyService service;

    @Test
    public void myTest() {
        // do test using injections
    }
}
....
