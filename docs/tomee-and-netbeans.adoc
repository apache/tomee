There is some great information over at
https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/tomee_apache_cxf_and_maven[Geertjan's
Blog] on how to hit the ground running with Netbeans, CXF and Maven.
Geertjan is a Netbeans evangelist and has an incredible insight into
everything Netbeans.

*WORKAROUND*: There is a known issue with Netbeans 8 and TomEE detection
that currently requires the following workaround:

Netbeans 8 has a bug in which it fails to find the
*tomee-common-[version].jar* in the *[TomEE]/lib* directory. The
solution is to simply rename the jar file to an older version.

For example, you have *[TomEE]/lib/tomee-common-1.6.0.2.jar* or
*[TomEE]/lib/tomee-common-1.7.1.jar*. Rename these files to
*[TomEE]/lib/tomee-common-1.6.0.jar*

This should resolve the detection issue and will not break your
installation - Be sure to document the change for yourself as a
reminder.

Here is a quick run through on how to set up TomEE. We will use one of
the existing examples for this demo. Let's import it.
