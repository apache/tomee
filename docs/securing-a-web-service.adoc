Web Services are a very common way to implement a Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA).

There are lots of web service standards/specifications (XML, SOAP, WSDL,
UUDI, WS-*, ...) coming from organizations like W3C, OASIS, WS-I, ...
And there are java web service standards like JAX-WS 1.x (JSR 181),
JAX-WS 2.0 (JSR 224).

OpenEJB provides a standard way to implement web services transport
protocol throughout the JAX-WS specification. Java basic standards for
web services (JAX-WS) do lack some features that are required in most
real world applications, e.g. standard ways for handling security and
authentication (there is no java specification for Oasis's WS-Security
specification).

OpenEJB provides two mechanisms to secure webservices - HTTP
authentication and WS-Security:

HTTPS : works at the transport level, enables a point-to-point security.
It has no impact on developments. It allows you :

[arabic]
. To secure data over the network with data encrypted during transport
. To identify the end user with SSLv3 with client certificate required
. OpenEJB supports BASIC authentication over HTTP(S), using the
configured JAAS provider. This will honour any EJB security roles you
have setup using

. See the webservice-security example in the OpenEJB codebase
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk/examples/

_Warning: Currently only BASIC is the only HTTP authentication mechanism
available when running OpenEJB standalone or in a unit test, but we hope
to support DIGEST in the future._

WS-Security: works at the message (SOAP) level, enables a higher-level
security, Nowadays, SOAP implementations use other protocols than just
HTTP so we need to apply security to the message itself and not only at
the transport layer. Moreover, HTTPS can only be used for securing
point-to-point services which tend to decrease with Enterprise Service
Bus for example.

The Oasis organization has defined a standard (part of well-known WS-*)
which aims at providing high level features in the context of web
services: WS-Security. It provides a standard way to secure your
services above and beyond transport level protocols such as HTTPS.
WS-Security relies on other standards like XML-Encryption.

Main features are:

[arabic]
. Timestamp a message,
. Pass credentials (plain text and/or ciphered) between services,
. Sign messages,
. Encrypt messages or part of messages.

Again, JAX-WS doesn't standardize security for web services. OpenEJB
provides a common and highly configurable way to configure WS-Security
in association with the JAX-WS usage without vendor dependence.
Internally, OpenEJB integrates Apache WSS4J as the WS-Security
implementation. To use the integration, you will need to configure WSS4J
using the _openejb-jar.xml_.

_Warning: the proposed WS-Security integration is only used at server
side. Currently, WS-Security client configuration is not managed by
OpenEJB. You can use the JAX-WS API to create a stub and then rely on
the implementation to set up WS-Security properties._

This configuration file lets you set up incoming and outgoing security
parameters. Incoming and outgoing configuration is independent so that
you can configure either one or the other or both. You can decide to
check client credentials for incoming messages and sign outgoing
messages (response).

# Configuration principles The configuration is made in the
_openejb-jar.xml_. Each endpoint web service can provide a set of
properties to customize WS-Security behavior through the element. The
content of this element is consistent with the overall structure of
_openejb.xml_. The format for properties is the same as if you would use
a common java property file.

....
<properties>
  wss4j.in.action = UsernameToken
  wss4j.in.passwordType = PasswordDigest
  wss4j.in.passwordCallbackClass=org.superbiz.calculator.CustomPasswordHandler
</properties>
....

In order to recover WSS4J properties both for input and output, we use
naming conventions. Each property is made of .<in|out>.=

For example : _wss4j.in.action = UsernameToken_

# Username Token (Password digest) example #### Excerpt from
_openejb-jar.xml_.

# JAAS with WS-Security

1 doesn't work straight off with WS-Security, but you can add calls to
the OpenEJB SecurityService to login to a JAAS provider to a
CallbackHandler. Once you have done this, any permissions configured
with 1 should be honoured.

Here is a snippet from the webservice-ws-security example demonstrating
this:

....
public class CustomPasswordHandler implements CallbackHandler {

    public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException, UnsupportedCallbackException {
        WSPasswordCallback pc = (WSPasswordCallback) callbacks[0];

        if (pc.getUsage() == WSPasswordCallback.USERNAME_TOKEN) {
            // TODO get the password from the users.properties if possible
            pc.setPassword("waterfall");

        } else if (pc.getUsage() == WSPasswordCallback.DECRYPT) {

            pc.setPassword("serverPassword");

        } else if (pc.getUsage() == WSPasswordCallback.SIGNATURE) {

            pc.setPassword("serverPassword");

        }

        if ((pc.getUsage() == WSPasswordCallback.USERNAME_TOKEN) || (pc.getUsage() == WSPasswordCallback.USERNAME_TOKEN_UNKNOWN)) {

            SecurityService securityService = SystemInstance.get().getComponent(SecurityService.class);
            Object token = null;
            try {
                securityService.disassociate();

                token = securityService.login(pc.getIdentifer(), pc.getPassword());
                securityService.associate(token);

            } catch (LoginException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
                throw new SecurityException("wrong password");
            }
        }
    }
}
....
