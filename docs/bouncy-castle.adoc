Installation of Bouncy Castle for use in TomEE itself is done in two
steps:

[arabic]
. Add the Bouncy Castle provider jar to the `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext`
directory
. Create a Bouncy Castle provider entry in the
`$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security` file

The entry to `java.security` will look something like the following:

....
security.provider.N=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
....

Replace `N` with the order of precedence you would like to give Bouncy
Castle in comparison to the other providers in the file. *Recommended*
would be the last entry in the list -- `N` being the higest number in
the list. *Warning* that configuring Bouncy Castle as the first
provider, `security.provider.1`, may cause JVM errors.
