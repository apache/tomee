Multicast is the preferred way to broadcast the heartbeat on the
network. The simple technique of broadcasting a non-changing service URI
on the network has specific advantages to multicast. The URI itself is
essentially stateless and there is no "i'm alive" URI or an "i'm dead"
URI.

In this way the issues with UDP being unordered and unreliable melt away
as state is no longer a concern and packet sizes are always small.
Complicated libraries that ride atop UDP and attempt to offer
reliability (retransmission) and ordering on UDP can be avoided. As well
the advantages UDP has over TCP are retained as there are no java layers
attempting to force UDP communication to be more TCP-like. The simple
design means UDP/Multicast is only used for discovery and from there on
out critical information is transmitted over TCP/IP which is obviously
going to do a better job at ensuring reliability and ordering.

== Server Configuration

When you boot the server there should be a `conf/multicast.properties`
file containing:

....
server      = org.apache.openejb.server.discovery.MulticastDiscoveryAgent
bind        = 239.255.2.3
port        = 6142
disabled    = true
group       = default
....

Just need to enable that by setting `disabled=false`. All of the above
settings except `server` can be changed. The `port` and `bind` must be
valid for general multicast/udp network communication.

The `group` setting can be changed to further group servers that may use
the same multicast channel. As shown below the client also has a `group`
setting which can be used to select an appropriate server from the
multicast channel.

== Multicast Client

The multicast functionality is not just for servers to find each other
in a cluster, it can also be used for EJB clients to discover a server.
A special `multicast://` URL can be used in the `InitialContext`
properties to signify that multicast should be used to seed the
connection process. Such as:

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,
"org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "multicast://239.255.2.3:6142?group=default");
InitialContext remoteContext = new InitialContext(p);
....

The URL has optional query parameters such as `schemes` and `group` and
`timeout` which allow you to zero in on a particular type of service of
a particular cluster group as well as set how long you are willing to
wait in the discovery process till finally giving up. The first matching
service that it sees "flowing" around on the UDP stream is the one it
picks and sticks to for that and subsequent requests, ensuring UDP is
only used when there are no other servers to talk to.

Note that EJB clients do not need to use multicast to find a server. If
the client knows the URL of a server in the cluster, it may use it and
connect directly to that server, at which point that server will share
the full list of its peers.

== Multicast Servers with TCP Clients

Note that clients do not need to use multicast to communicate with
servers. Servers can use multicast to discover each other, but clients
are still free to connect to servers in the network using the server's
TCP address.

....
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,  "org.apache.openejb.client.RemoteInitialContextFactory");
p.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "ejbd://192.168.1.30:4201");
InitialContext remoteContext = new InitialContext(p);
....

When the client connects, the server will send the URLs of all the
servers in the group and failover will take place normally.
