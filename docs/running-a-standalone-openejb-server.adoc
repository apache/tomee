# Configuring the OpenEJB Runtime The OpenEJB Eclipse plugin provides
support for running OpenEJB as a standalone server in Eclipse using WTP.

To setup a server, first of all, you will need to have a copy of OpenEJB
extracted on your machine. Once you have that, the next step is to set
up a runtime.

To set up a new runtime, click on Window, Preferences, and select
Installed Runtimes under the Server category. Click the Add button.

Select OpenEJB 3.0.0 from the Apache category, and click next. If you
choose to 'also create a new server' on this panel, you can add a server
straight after configuring the runtime.

Browse to, or enter the path to your copy of OpenEJB. Click on Finish.

# Configuring the OpenEJB Server Open the Servers view (if it isn't
already), and right click and select New->Server.

# Deploying a project In order to deploy your project to an OpenEJB
server in Eclipse, your project must be a Java EE project, with the EJB
facet enabled. If your project doesn't have the Faceted nature, you can
use the OpenEJB plugin to add it. Simply select OpenEJB->Add Faceted
Nature from the menu bar.

To add the EJB facet, right click on the project in the navigator, and
select Properties. Select Project Facets on the left hand side. Click on
the Modify Project button.

OpenEJB runtime too. Click Next.
