# Understanding the Directory Layout
:index-group: OpenEJB Standalone Server
:jbake-date: 2018-12-05
:jbake-type: page
:jbake-status: published


Unpacking the standalone OpenEJB will result in the following directory
layout:

....
apache-openejb-[version]\apps
apache-openejb-[version]\bin
apache-openejb-[version]\conf
apache-openejb-[version]\data
apache-openejb-[version]\lib
apache-openejb-[version]\logs
apache-openejb-[version]\LICENSE
apache-openejb-[version]\NOTICE
apache-openejb-[version]\README.txt
....

# Directories

== bin/

Contains commands to start/stop the server (You can also do a lot of
other stuff like deploy/undeploy, but we will just talk about things
needed to get you started)

== lib/

Contains several jar files (you only need of few of these jars in your
classpath to do EJB development)

== apps/

Once you create your EJB's and jar them up, you can place your jar file
in this directory and start the server. The server will automatically
deploy all the EJB's contained in this JAR.

== logs/

Contains log files.

== conf/

This directory contains nothing but a README.txt file at the time
OpenEJB is unpacked. The first time OpenEJB is started however, these
files will be created:

....
  conf/
    openejb.xml            (main config file)    
    logging.properties         (log levels and files)    
    login.config           (jaas config file)
    users.properties           (users that can log in)
    groups.properties          (groups in which users belong)

    conf.d/

        admin.properties        (network socket for administration)
        ejbd.properties         (network socket for ejb invocations)
        hsql.properties         (network socket for hsql client access)
        httpejbd.properties     (network socket for ejb invocations over http)
        telnet.properties       (network socket for telnet "server") 
....

These files can be edited as desired. If at any time you are unhappy
with your changes or simply wish to start over, you can delete or move
any of the files above and a new one containing the default values will
be automatically created.
