ActiveMQ is the default JMS provider in Apache TomEE and OpenEJB.

Changing JMS implementation is as simple as using that implementation's
Java EE Connector. The connector which will be a `.rar` file should be
bundled with the application in a `.ear` file. All JMS usage in that
`.ear` will favor the JMS ConnectionFactory and Topic and Queue
implementations that are configured in the `.rar` file rather than
ActiveMQ.

If the JMS implementation does not have a `.rar` file, there are still
some options for wiring in an alternate implementation.

== Generic JMS Resource Adapter

If the JMS implementation does not have a Resource Archive (`.rar` file)
that defines a compliant Resource Adapter, the
http://genericjmsra.java.net/[Generic Resource Adapter for JMS] should
work fine.

To use this Adapter in TomEE or OpenEJB you'll need to create a
`service-jar.xml` file and include that in a jar file and add it to the
`<tomee.home>/lib/` directory. Then you can declare `ConnectionFactory`,
`Topic`, and `Queue` and more via the `tomee.xml` file.

The one below should be considered boiler plate. Updating it to contain
some useful default values for your JMS implementation would be good.
These values can be overridden in the `tomee.xml` or `openejb.xml`

Let's say that the following file lives in the jar at
`META-INF/org.superbiz/service-jar.xml`

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ServiceJar>
  <ServiceProvider
      id="genericra"
      service="Resource"
      types="GenericJMSRA"
      class-name="com.sun.genericra.GenericJMSRA">
          UserName
          Password
          ProviderIntegrationMode
          ConnectionFactoryClassName
          QueueConnectionFactoryClassName
          TopicConnectionFactoryClassName
          XAConnectionFactoryClassName
          XAQueueConnectionFactoryClassName
          XATopicConnectionFactoryClassName
          UnifiedDestinationClassName
          TopicClassName
          QueueClassName
          SupportsXA
          ConnectionFactoryProperties
          JndiProperties
          CommonSetterMethodName
          RMPolicy
          LogLevel
          DeliveryType
          UseFirstXAForRedelivery
  </ServiceProvider>

  <ServiceProvider
      id="ConnectionFactory"
      service="Resource"
      types="javax.jms.ConnectionFactory, javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory, javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory, QueueConnectionFactory, TopicConnectionFactory"
      class-name="com.sun.genericra.outbound.ManagedJMSConnectionFactory">
          ConnectionFactoryJndiName
          ClientId
          ConnectionValidationEnabled
          ResourceAdapter
  </ServiceProvider>

  <ServiceProvider
      id="Queue"
      service="Resource"
      types="javax.jms.Queue, Queue"
      class-name="com.sun.genericra.outbound.QueueProxy">
          DestinationJndiName
          ResourceAdapter
          UserName
          Password
          JndiProperties
          QueueClassName
  </ServiceProvider>

  <ServiceProvider
      id="Topic"
      service="Resource"
      types="javax.jms.Topic, Topic"
      class-name="com.sun.genericra.outbound.TopicProxy">
          DestinationJndiName
          ResourceAdapter
          UserName
          Password
          JndiProperties
          TopicClassName
  </ServiceProvider>
</ServiceJar>
....

It is strongly recommended to not leave the values in the
service-jar.xml file blank as shown above. It is possible to setup
several sets of defaults in a `service-jar.xml` or via several
`service-jar.xml` files.

Once this file is packed in a jar and added to the `<tomee.home>/lib` or
`<openejb.home>/lib` directory, you can then declare and configure
"instances" of these things in your `tomee.xml` or `openejb.xml` config
file as follows:

....
<Resource id="My Generic Adapter" type="GenericJMSRA" provider="org.superbiz:genericra">
AdapterProperty1 PropertyValue1
AdapterProperty2 PropertyValue2
...
</Resource>
....

Or in properties like so:

....
myGenericAdapter = new://Resource?type=GenericJMSRA&provider=org.superbiz:genericra
myGenericAdapter.AdapterProperty1 = PropertyValue1
myGenericAdapter.AdapterProperty2 = PropertyValue2
....

This is basically the same as all configuration in TomEE/OpenEJB, but
with the addition that you must specify the `provider` attribute so the
server knows where to look for the `service-jar.xml` file that defines
the resource and all its defaults.

In this example:

* the file is `META-INF/org.superbiz/service-jar.xml`
* so the `provider` attribute is `org.superbiz`

You can use whatever prefix you like for the `provider` id, though for
obvious reasons we'd advise not using `org.apache.openejb` or
`org.apache.tomee` in the prefix.
