If you prefer, TomEE can be setup by deploying a .war file into an
existing Tomcat 7.x installation, as opposed to using the all-in-one
bundle. This guide provides a set of step-by-step instructions to this
approach. Please note that TomEE 1.7.x does not recommend Tomcat
versions less than 7.0.54. Tomcat 8 is not currently supported in the
released version, but you can check out the developer branch to see
progress link:dev/source-code.html[here].

* Download the Apache Tomcat 7.0.55 server.
http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
* Unzip the Tomcat distribution file.
* Update $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml to add a tomee user to
allow access to the installer page.
+
....
 <!-- Activate/create these lines to get access to TomEE GUI -->
 <role rolename="tomee-admin" />
 <user username="tomee" password="tomee" roles="tomee-admin" />
....
* Download the .war file you wish to use - either the
tomee-webapp-1.7.1.war (for the webprofile installation) or
tomee-webapp-plus-1.7.1.war (for the plus version).
* Copy and rename the .war file to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/tomee.war (the
.war filename is important).
* Start Tomcat.
* Go to the TomEE installer webapp (http://localhost:8080/tomee/) and
login with the user you added to tomcat-users.xml.
* Verify the values and click "Confirm".
