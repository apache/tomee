== Connecting To OpenEJB or TomEE Through SSH

=== Description

It can be very useful to connect to the server to get some informations.

=== Solution

For such a case OpenEJB/TomEE proposes to start with the Java EE server
a SSH server. Currently the security is based on JAAS (see how to
configure JAAS for TomEE for more information about it).

=== Installation

Simply extract the openejb-ssh jar in the lib of tomee
(webapps/tomee/lib) or openejb libs (lib folder). Then simply connect
using your JAAS credential.

Note: you can use the provisioning features of openejb to do this job!

Then simply activate the service manage: it is done setting the system
property openejb.servicemanager.enabled to true.

Note: it can be done through the conf/system.properties file. Note2:
please take care to not add space after true (not 'true ' for instance).

=== OpenEJB SSH Shell

Once you are connected you get some commands:

* deploy : deploy an application
* undeploy : undeploy an application
* list: list deployed EJBs
* classloader : print the classloader tree of the app specified by the
id
* jmx : interact with JMX ** jmx list: list mbeans ** jmx get ** jmx set
** jmx invoke ([, ...)
* properties: print server configuration as properties
* script
+
+
: execute the following script code using the following language with
the JSR 223
* script file
+
+
: execute the following script using the language (from the extension of
the file) with the JSR 223
* ls []: list the file in path is specified or in the base of the server
if not
* cat : print a file
* part - : print the part of a file

Note1: JSR 223 can need to add some jar to openejb/tomee lib folder
(groovy-all for instance to use groovy) Note2: ls, part, cat commands
have to use $home and $base properties to specified the path
