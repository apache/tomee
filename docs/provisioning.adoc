== Summary

Provioning is about the way to get binaries or information. It is the
answer to how do i get my application, my webapp, my configuration.

TomEE and OpenEJB brings some help about it allowing you to point out
some resources instead of providing it directly.

This indirection is clearly very useful to industrialize your software
or simply to cloudify it.

== A word about this page

This page will not explain you how to deploy an application or how to
enhance your container. It will simply explain you how which kind of
urls are supported for such features.

These feature are explained in other places.

== Supported provionings

=== file

This is the default and well know provisioning. Simply give a file path
the container is able to access through its filesystem.

Example:

....
/MIDDLE/foo/bar/my-local-file.jar
....

=== Http/https

Here you give an url to access the desired file. Proxies used are the
JVM ones.

Example:

....
http://atos.net/foo/bar/my-http-file.jar 
....

=== Maven

==== Usage

Probably the most fun but very useful for cloud deployments: maven. Use
maven informations to deploy your application.

The location should follow:

....
mvn:groupId/artifactId[/[version]/[type]]
....

or

....
mvn:groupId:artifactId[:[version]:[type]]
....

Note: classifier are supported (through version field)

For instance you can use:

....
mvn:net.atos.xa/my-application/1.0.0/war
....

==== Installation

The maven url parsing is not included by default in OpenEJB/TomEE
bundle. It needs to be installed.

If you are using an embedded application and maven simply add
org.apache.openejb:openejb-provisionning:VERSION dependency.

If you are using TomEE you have to extract the
org.apache.openejb:openejb-provisionning zip in the same classloader
than tomee (webapps/tomee/lib for instance, for other places please have
a look to other tip pages).

Another way to install it with tomee is to edit or create the file
/conf/provisioning.properties and add the line:

....
zip=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/openejb/openejb-provisionning/<version>/openejb-provisionning-<version>.zip
....
