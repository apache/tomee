# Maven Information

This page is intended to provide an insight into basic [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) usage for users that are not all that familiar with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects.
It is by no means a tutorial and is designed to be more of a *quickstart* to get you up and running.

You can find a really good [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) tutorial here: [http://books.sonatype.com/mvnex-book/reference/public-book.html](http://books.sonatype.com/mvnex-book/reference/public-book.html)

It is assumed that:

 - You have downloaded and installed [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and that you can run **mvn --version** from any command prompt (or console).
 - You have downloaded and installed [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) and that you can run **svn --version** from any command prompt or console.

It is also assumed you have downloaded one of the following:

 - One of the example projects from [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk/examples]()
 - The entire project source from [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)
 
Use [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) to checkout the example sources from a console like so:
 
	svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk/examples/[example]
		
Or that you may of course also be using your own project pom.xml

If you want to use the latest snapshot locate the *<repositories>* section in your pom.xml and ensure the following repository exists:
	
	<repositories>
	  <repository>
	    <id>apache-m2-snapshot</id>
	    <name>Apache M2 Snapshot Repository</name>
	    <url>http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/</url>
	    <releases>
	  	  <enabled>false</enabled>
	    </releases>
	    <snapshots>
	  	  <enabled>true</enabled>
	    </snapshots>
	  </repository>
	</repositories>
