# Basic Usage

To use OpenEJB's Telnet Console, simply boot your server normally.

_____________________
$ ./bin/openejb start
_____________________

....
OPENEJB_HOME=/Users/dblevins/Desktop/openejb-1.0
OpenEJB 1.0    build: 20060226-1701
http://www.openejb.org
resources 1
OpenEJB ready.
[init]
....

OpenEJB Remote Server ** Starting Services ** NAME IP PORT +

telnet 0.0.0.0 4202 +
ejbd 0.0.0.0 4201 +

Then in another shell telnet in

# Configuring the Telnet Service

The configuration of all server services (network facing services) is
done in xinet.d style config files. The telnet shell is controlled via
the $OPENEJB_HOME/conf/telnet.properties file. This file is created for
you automatically after the first time OpenEJB boots.

____________________________
$ cat conf/telnet.properties
____________________________

....
    server  = org.openejb.server.telnet.TelnetServer
    bind    = 127.0.0.1
    port    = 4202
    disabled    = false
    threads = 5
#   only_from   = 192.168.1.123
....

You can change the IP, port, and even the number of threads allowed to
concurrently access the Telnet service via this file.

# Disabling the Telnet Service

Simply edit the config file and set 'disabled' to true

....
    disabled    = true
....

Then restart OpenEJB.

# Restricting Access

It is unlikely you want just anyone to be able to login and execute
commands. While you can't restrict access on a user basis, yet, you can
restrict access to specific hosts. Host based access control (HBA) is a
built-in part of any Server Service in OpenEJB and the Telnet Service is
no different. This is done with the 'only_from' property, which like the
rest of the file is a direct copy of the xinet.d syntax for HBA.

For an example to restrict access to the localhost, you could configure
the Telnet Service like this:

....
    server  = org.openejb.server.telnet.TelnetServer
    bind    = 127.0.0.1
    port    = 4202
    disabled    = false
    threads = 5
    only_from   = localhost
....

If you wanted to restrict access to localhost _and_ say the hosts
192.168.1.207 and 192.168.1.16, you can simply add them to the list.

....
    server  = org.openejb.server.telnet.TelnetServer
    bind    = 127.0.0.1
    port    = 4202
    disabled    = false
    threads = 5
    only_from   = localhost, 192.168.1.207, 192.168.1.16
....
