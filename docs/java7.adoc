If you compile your applications on JDK7 you have to run Apache TomEE
1.0 on jdk7

== Configuring TomEE to use JDK7

If you have multiple JDK installed on your system you should set
JAVA_HOME in your stratup scripts. For example if your `JAVA_HOME` is
`/usr/local/java/current` edit `catalina.sh` and add a line

`JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/current/bin`

Alternatively, set `JAVA_HOME` as an environment variable prior to
calling `<tomee-home>/bin/startup.sh`

== Endorsed libraries directory

TomEE 1.0 package comes with and "endorsed" direcotry which contains
updates for core JDK6 libraries. If you are running JDK7 you should
remove al files in this directory.

TomEE 1.1 will detect JDK7 and will not load those files
