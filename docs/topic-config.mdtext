Title: Topic Configuration


A Topic can be declared via xml in the `<tomee-home>/conf/tomee.xml` file or in a `WEB-INF/resources.xml` file using a declaration like the following.  All properties in the element body are optional.

    <Resource id="myTopic" type="javax.jms.Topic">
        destination = 
    </Resource>

Alternatively, a Topic can be declared via properties in the `<tomee-home>/conf/system.properties` file or via Java VirtualMachine `-D` properties.  The properties can also be used when embedding TomEE via the `javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer` API or `InitialContext`

    myTopic = new://Resource?type=javax.jms.Topic
    myTopic.destination = 

Properties and xml can be mixed.  Properties will override the xml allowing for easy configuration change without the need for ${} style variable substitution.  Properties are not case sensitive.  If a property is specified that is not supported by the declared Topic a warning will be logged.  If a Topic is needed by the application and one is not declared, TomEE will create one dynamically using default settings.  Multiple Topic declarations are allowed.
