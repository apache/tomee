Windows NT Service==================The two batch files for creating and removing TomEE as a Windows Service are basicallyself explanatory. Both scripts must be run using an account that has rights to installor de-install a service. This is usually an administrator account.service.install.as.admin.batservice.remove.as.admin.batNOTE: Both scripts actually call the service.bat file, if you modify this batch file then ensure that there are no hiddencharacters after the '^' continuation symbol (such as tab or space). But always ensurethere is a space before (and not a tab). The service installer will drop further optionsand simply warn that '++JvmOptions' is unknown, leading to unexpected results.++JvmOptions=-Dcatalina.base="%CATALINA_BASE%" ^++JvmOptions=-Xms128M ^[tab or space] <-- Will break here, no further options will be appended++JvmOptions=-Xmx512M ^++JvmOptions=-XX:MaxPermSize=256M <-- Last line has no continuation symbolUsing a Defined JRE or JDK==========================The service script searches for and uses an installed Java runtime.If you want to override this feature to use a specific runtime then edit the 'service.bat' file.set "JAVA_HOME=[Full path to your JRE or JDK]"Be aware if you override the runtime that the service installer uses native 32 bit x86, 64 bit ia64 and 64 bit amd64executables to invoke the selected java runtime. For example, you cannot execute a 32 bit JRE using a 64 bit service.If this is required then you will have to override the %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% variable.Using the Monitor=================The file named 'TomEE.exe' can be used to modify service parameters post installation by running as an Administrator.To use the monitor feature:1. Create a shortcut to 'TomEE.exe' in your 'Startup' directory2. Right click the shortcut and select 'Properties'3. Edit the 'Target' field and append  //MS to the end of the line (Do not forget the preceding space ...\bin\TomEE.exe //MS)
