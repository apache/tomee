=== Changes in TomEE EAP 1.7.5-TT.15

This security release fixes the following issues:

* CVE-2017-12617 (Tomcat) Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The AbstractFileResourceSet class allows arbitrary files to be uploaded when running on the Windows operating system.

After uploading, the attacker can then request the file from the server causing the malicious code to execute on the server.
