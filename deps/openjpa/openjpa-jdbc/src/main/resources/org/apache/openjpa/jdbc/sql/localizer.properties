union-sql-placeholder: Aborting UNION: cannot select placeholder for \
	non-column select SQL.
union-number-ordering: Aborting UNION: different numbers of order-by criteria \
	in selects.
union-incompat-ordering: Aborting UNION: incompatible ordering columns/sql or \
	direction.
union-unaligned-ordering: Aborting UNION: your database does not support \
	ordering columns/sql that appear at different positions in the SELECTs \
	that make up the UNION.
union-element: Individual selects involved in a UNION do not support this \
	operation.
incompat-ordering: This query cannot be completed.  The SQL SELECTs needed \
	to complete the query have incompatible ordering.  Their results cannot \
	be merged.
unpadded-char-cols: You are using CHAR columns with a data source or driver \
	that does not implement OraclePreparedStatement.setFixedCHAR(). \
	Comparisons on unpadded string values may fail.
unconfigured-nchar-cols: You are using NCHAR or NCLOB columns with a \
	data source or driver \
	that does not implement OraclePreparedStatement.setFormOfUse(). \
	Storing unicode values may fail or be corrupted.
diff-values: Attempt to set column "{0}" to two different values: \
	({1})"{2}", ({3})"{4}" \
	This can occur when you fail to set both sides of a two-sided relation \
	between objects, or when you map different fields to the same column, but \
	you do not keep the values of these fields in synch.
feature-not-supported: The database dictionary in use ("{0}") reports that it \
	does not have feature "{1}".  This feature is needed to complete the \
	current operation.  To force OpenJPA to try to use the feature anyway, set \
	the following property:\n\
	openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: {1}=<value>
cant-outer-fk: Could not outer join the given foreign key "{0}" due to syntax \
	and foreign key limitations.  The join was converted to an inner join.
no-auto-assign: This database dictionary does not support auto-assigned column \
	values.
bad-join: The following error was detected when creating a foreign key: \
	"{0}".  The foreign key is being ignored.
sybase-compliance: The Sybase connection URL "{0}" may be invalid: \
	it does not contain the parameter "BE_AS_JDBC_COMPLIANT_AS_POSSIBLE=true", \
	which is required for the Sybase JConnect driver to behave in a \
	JDBC-compliant way.
sqlserver-cachedstmnts: The Microsoft JDBC driver has bugs that manifest \
	themselves when prepared statements are pooled.  Please disable prepared \
	statement pooling when using the Microsoft JDBC driver by including \
	"MaxCachedStatements=0" in your org.apache.openjpa.ConnectionFactoryProperties \
	configuration property.
sqlserver-netdirect-batch: The JNetDirect JDBC driver has problems when using \
	batch statements. Please disable prepared \
	statement pooling when using the this JDBC driver by including \
	"BatchLimit=0" in your openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary \
	configuration property.
sqlserver-cursor: The SQLServer connection URL "{0}" may be invalid: \
	it does not contain the parameter "SelectMethod=cursor", which is \
	necessary for the driver to properly support large result sets.
oracle-syntax: Oracle 8 does not support SQL92 syntax.  You can avoid \
	this message by setting the "JoinSyntax" DBDictionary property \
	to "database". \
	For example:\n\
	openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: oracle(JoinSyntax=database)
oracle-batch-lob: LOB operations not allowed for batched statement: {0}
oracle-batch-bug: The Oracle 9.2 JDBC driver has problems with \
	batch statements and has been disabled by default.  You can \
	enable batched statements by setting the "BatchLimit" DBDictionary \
	property.  You may be able to bypass this problem by disabling \
	prepared statement pooling. The compatible 9.0.1 driver does not \
	have this behavior.
oracle-batch-override: The BatchLimit property was set even though \
	the Oracle 9.2 driver may not support this behavior correctly. \
	If you see a number of invalid update count errors, you should \
	disable statement batching by setting the BatchLimit property to 0.
oracle-connecting-for-driver: OpenJPA is now connecting to the database in order \
	to figure out what JDBC driver you are using, as OpenJPA must alter its \
	behavior for this database depending on the driver vendor.  To avoid this \
	connection, set the DriverVendor value in your openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary \
	configuration property to one of the following values:\n\
	oracle, oracle92 (for the 9.2 driver), datadirect, datadirect61 \
	(for driver versions <= 3.1), other \n\
	For example:\n\
	openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: oracle(DriverVendor=oracle92)
oracle-constant: Cannot outer join tables "{0}" and "{1}" using native \
	join syntax and constant joins.  If you are using Oracle 9 or higher, \
	you should instead use SQL92 joins by specifying the JoinSyntax \
	value in the openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary configuration property:\n\
	openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: oracle(JoinSyntax=sql92).
oracle-savepoint: An error occurred when attempting to set an Oracle \
	savepoint "{0}".  You must use Oracle driver and database 9.2 or higher.
oracle-rollback: An error occurred when attempting to rollback to an Oracle \
	savepoint "{0}".  You must use Oracle driver and database 9.2 or higher.
oracle-unknown-svpt: Could not find an OracleConnection instance from this \
	connection class "{0}".
db2-cant-lock: DB2 cannot perform FOR UPDATE selects on multiple tables. \
	The tables used in this select are: "{0}".  You should either configure \
	your application to avoid multi-table selects, use optimistic locking, \
	or set the "SimulateLocking" DBDictionary property to allow non-locking \
	selects within pessimistic transactions.
informix-cant-lock: Informix cannot perform FOR UPDATE selects on multiple \
	tables, or when it is a SELECT DISTINCT.  The tables used in this select \
	are: "{0}".  You should either configure your application to avoid \
	multi-table/distinct selects, use optimistic locking, or set the \
	"SimulateLocking" DBDictionary property to allow non-locking selects \
	within pessimistic transactions.
bad-param: The specified parameter of type "{0}" is not a valid query parameter.
warn-generic: Your database configuration was not recognized as a supported \
	OpenJPA database. The generic dictionary will be used, which may result in \
	limited functionality. This behavior can be overridden by specifying the \
	appropriate dictionary class in the "openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" \
	property of the OpenJPA configuration.
using-dict: Using dictionary class "{0}"{1}.
dict-info: Connected to {0} version {1}.{2} using JDBC driver {3} version {4}. 
no-pessimistic: This dictionary ({0}) does not support locking, so \
	operations may not be performed using a Broker that does not have \
	optimistic locking enabled.
no-fk-table: Foreign key "{0}" on table "{1}" references a table \
	("{2}") that was not found.
dd-lock-bug: This version of the DataDirect JDBC driver has a bug that \
	prevents SELECT FOR UPDATE statements from working.  Please \
	use version 3.2 or higher of the driver.
storage-restriction: The database "{0}" has restrictions that prevent it \
	from being able to store the value "{1}" of type "{2}". The value \
	will be rounded to "{3}" for storage.
dict-not-supported: This database dictionary "{0}" is not officially supported \
	by OpenJPA.
invalid-autoassign: This database dictionary "{0}" does not support \
	auto-assigned column values.  The column "{1}" may not behave as desired.
psql-no-set-fetch-size:	This version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver does not \
	support the Statement.setFetchSize() method. OpenJPA will no longer attempt \
	to set the statement fetch size. To suppress this warning, ensure that \
	the org.apache.openjpa.FetchBatchSize configuration property is set to zero. The \
	original PostgreSQL driver exception is being logged for your reference.
no-genkey: The last generated key query did not return any results.
invalid-genkey: The column "{0}" was marked as being auto-assigned, but \
	the server reported that the assigned value was null.
indexof-not-supported: The database "{0}" does not support the \
	indexOf function.
substring-not-supported: The database "{0}" does not support the \
	substring function.
null-result-provider: supplied array of result object providers is null
empty-result-provider: supplied array of result object providers is empty
null-shared-result-set: supplied result set is null
illegal-method: {0}.{1}() is illegal to be invoked
column-not-mapped: SQLResultSetMapping "{0}" does not map the columns "{1}" \
	that are selected by the SQL query\r\n "{2}"
dictionary-configuration: DBDictionary configuration: \n{0}
oracle-timestamp-bug: An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException has occurred when \
    getting a timestamp value. This can happen when using versions of the \
    Oracle JDBC driver greater than 9.2 in conjunction with a server version \
    less than 9.2. Downgrading the driver will solve this, or it can be \
    worked around by setting the "SupportsTimestampNanos" DBDictionary \
    property to "true".
isolation-level-config-not-supported: This DBDictionary does not support \
    customization of isolation levels on a per-query basis. DBDictionary: {0}.
millis-query-timeout: JDBC locking does not support millisecond-granularity \
    timeouts.  Use timeouts that are multiples of 1000 for even second values.
db-not-supported: The database product "{0}", version "{1}" is not officially supported.
stream-exception: Unexpected error recovering the row to stream the LOB.
batch_unlimit: The batch limit was changed from unlimited (-1) to {0}.
function-not-supported: The database dictionary in use ("{0}") \
	does not support "{1}" function.
batch-update-success-count: ExecuteBatch command returns update success count {0}
connection-defaults: Initial connection autoCommit: {0}, holdability: {1}, \
    TransactionIsolation: {2}
long-table-name: Table name "{0}" is {1}-character long. The database allows \
	maximum {2}-character for a table name. 
long-column-name: Column name "{0}" is {1}-character long. The database allows \
	maximum {2}-character for a column name. 
long-index-name: Index name "{0}" is {1}-character long. The database allows \
	maximum {2}-character for an index name. 
long-constraint-name: Constraint name "{0}" is {1}-character long. The \
	database allows maximum {2}-character for a constraint name. 
long-seq-name: Sequence name "{0}" is {1}-character long. The database allows \
	maximum {2}-character for a sequence name.
null-blob-in-not-nullable: Can not set null value on column "{0}" \
	because the corresponding field is set to be non-nullable.
invalid-timeout: An invalid timeout of {0} milliseconds was ignored.  \
        Expected a value that is greater than or equal to zero.
error-setting-query-timeout: A SQLException was thrown when trying to set the \
	queryTimeout to {0}. We believe the exception is not fatal and will \
    continue processing. If this is a benign error you may disable it entirely \
	by setting the supportsQueryTimeout attribute on the DBDictionary to false.\
	The exception thrown was {1}.
dbcp-unwrap-failed: Unable to get underlying connection from DBCP pooled \
	connection. Make sure the DBCP property AccessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed \
	is enabled.
connection-unwrap-failed: Unable to get underlying connection from pooled \
	connection. Java version 6 and a version 4 capable JDBC driver \
	or data source are minimum requirements to perform this operation.
cannot-determine-identifier-case: Unable to determine the case to use for delimited \
    identifiers.  The default value of "preserve" will be used.
unknown-delim-support: Unable to determine whether delimited identifiers are supported. \
    The use of delimiters will not be supported.
can_not_get_current_schema: Unable to get current schema. SQLException message is "{0}".
cannot-determine-identifier-base-case: Unable to determine the case to use for \
    identifiers.  The default value of "{0}" will be used.
can-not-execute: Unable to execute {0}.
psql-owned-seq-warning: Unable to determine which sequences are owned by the database. \
	OpenJPA will consider all sequences suffixed with "_seq" as database managed.  This \
	may result in improper creation or removal of sequences with this suffix. The \
	original PostgreSQL driver exception is being logged for your reference.
sequencesql-override: Going to override the DB2 specific default for the \
    DBDictionary.sequenceSQL string, which is: "{0}" \
    with the value of: "{1}", which is the default sequenceSQL string for DB2 on the give operating system.  \
    If the user intends to use a value of: "{0}" by defining it as a DBDictionary property, \
    please change the case of at least one of the characters of the string defined in \
    the property.  This will allow openJPA to detect a difference between the DB2 default \
    string and the string set in the property and will further allow openJPA to use the \
    string defined by the property rather than the default string for DB2.
invalid-locking-mode: Invalid locking mode for SolidDB: "{0}"
oracle-set-clob-warning: Setting the supportsSetClob property on the OracleDictionary no longer has an \
    effect.  The functionality provided by the supportsSetClob property  is now enabled, by default.
jdbc4-setbinarystream-unsupported: The JRE or JDBC level in use does not support the \
    JDBC 4.0 version of the "java.sql.PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream" method which is \
    necessary when the property "openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary=useJDBC4SetBinaryStream" is \
    set to true.  A prior version of this method will be used.    
sequence-cache-warning: Setting the useNativeSequenceCache property on the DBDictionary no longer has an \
    effect.  Code has been added to allow, by default, the functionality provided in previous releases \
    via the useNativeSequenceCache property.
