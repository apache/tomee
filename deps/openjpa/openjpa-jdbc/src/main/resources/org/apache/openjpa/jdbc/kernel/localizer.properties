error-rollback: An error occurred attempting to rollback to the savepoint "{0}"
error-save: An error occurred attempting to set the savepoint "{0}".  This \
	driver may not support JDBC 3 savepoints.
mult-mapping-aggregate: Cannot perform an aggregate query on a hierarchy with \
	unjoined subclasses: {0}
sqlquery-missing-params: SQL query "{0}" declares a parameter index "{1}" for \
	which no value was given.  The given parameters were: {2}
sqlquery-fewer-params: SQL query "{0}" declares {1} distinct parameter(s), \
	but only {2} parameters are given. Given parameter values are "{3}".  
no-sql: You have not specified a SQL filter to execute in your SQL query.
del-ins-cycle: An unresolvable constraint cycle was detected.  This typically \
	means that you are persisting a new object with the same primary key value \
	as an object you are deleting in the same transaction, and at the same \
	time you have circular foreign key dependencies in the transaction.  The \
	combination of these two factors can sometimes lead to a situation in \
	which OpenJPA cannot meet all the database constraints.
ref-cycle: An unresolvable constraint cycle was detected.  This typically \
	means that a mapping in a table other than the class'' primary table has \
	a foreign key that is part of a circular foreign key dependency.  OpenJPA \
	sometimes cannot meet circular dependencies when some of the involved \
	mappings are in secondary tables.
update-failed-no-failed-obj: Database operation failed. Update count for SQL \
    statement was {0}. Statement: {1}
virtual-mapping: Cannot instantiate virtual mapping "{0}".
press-key-end: Server running.  Press enter to stop.
no-server-conf: There is no persistence server configured.
server-usage: Usage: \
    java org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.StartPersistenceServer\n\
	\t[-properties/-p <properties file or resource>]\n\
	\t[-<property name> <property value>]* 
cant-lock-on-load: The database is unable to lock this query.  Each object \
	matching the query will be locked individually after it is loaded; \
	however, it is technically possible that another transaction could modify \
	the data before the lock is obtained.  See the documentation on Object \
	Locking for details.\n"{0}" 
start-trans-for-lock: Though you are using optimistic transactions, OpenJPA is \
	now beginning a datastore transaction because you have requested a lock \
	on some data.
millis-query-timeout: JDBC locking does not support millisecond-granularity \
    timeouts.  Use timeouts that are multiples of 1000 for even second values.
batch-not-supported: The update count for the statement was an invalid \
	value ({0}). This indicates that your database or JDBC driver does not \
	have complete support for executing batch statements. Batch \
	functionality should be disabled by including "BatchLimit=0" in \
	your openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary configuration property. Statement: {1}
bad-synch-mappings: Invalid SynchronizeMappings operation ("{0}") specified. \
	Valid operations are: {1}
make-native-seq: Creating sequence.
drop-native-seq: Dropping sequence.
make-seq-table: Creating sequence table.
drop-seq-table: Dropping sequence table.
bad-seq-up: Attempt to update the sequence table "{0}" failed.  The sequence \
	table is typically created when you run the mappingtool''s refresh action \
	on any datastore identity class. If you have not run the mappingtool but \
	want to create the sequence table, run:\n\
	java org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.TableJDBCSeq -action add
bad-seq-type: This sequence of type "{0}" cannot generate values for \
	persistent type "{1}".
no-seq-sql: Error instantiating named sequence "{0}": Your database dictionary \
	does not support native sequences.  To tell the dictionary how to select \
	sequence values, use:\n\
	openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: NextSequenceQuery="SELECT NEXT VALUE \
    FOR "{0}"\n\
	Where the above string is replaced with the proper SQL for your database.
invalid-seq-sql: No rows returned for sql "{0}".  Check your configuration.
insert-seq: Inserting row for this mapping into sequence table.
no-seq-row: There is no row for mapping "{0}" in sequence table "{1}", and \
	the attempt to insert a row has apparently failed.
update-seq: Updating sequence values.
null-join: Attempt to add a null/empty fetch join field.
get-seq: Getting current sequence values.
seq-usage: Usage: java org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.TableJDBCSeq\n\
	\t[-properties/-p <properties file or resource>]\n\
	\t[-<property name> <property value>]*\n\
	\t-action/-a <add | drop | get | set> [value]
clstable-seq-usage: Usage: \
    java org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.ClassTableJDBCSeq\n\
	\t[-properties/-p <properties file or resource>]\n\
	\t[-<property name> <property value>]*\n\
	\t-action/-a <add | drop | get | set>\n\
	\t[class name | .java file | .class file | .jdo file] [value]
native-seq-usage: Usage: java org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.NativeJDBCSeq\n\
	\t[-properties/-p <properties file or resource>]\n\
	\t[-<property name> <property value>]*
bad-level: Invalid isolation level. Valid levels are -1, \
    "none"(0), "read-uncommitted"(1), "read-committed"(2), \
    "repeatable-read"(4) or "serializable"(8). Specified value: {0}.
no-nullable-fk: No nullable foreign key found to resolve circular flush \
	dependency. During flush processing, changes to instances, new \
	instances, and deleted instances must be processed in a specific sequence \
	to avoid foreign key constraint violations. The changes required in this \
	transaction cannot be reordered because none of the foreign key constraints \
	is nullable (optional).
graph-not-cycle-free: A circular flush dependency has been found after all \
    circular dependencies should have been resolved.
batch_limit: The batch limit is set to {0}.
batch_update_info: ExecuteBatch command returns update count {0} for \
	statement {1}.
strong-exclusion: excluded permanently
weak-exclusion: excluded temporarily	
prepared-query-excluded-by-user: because matches user specified exclusion \
	pattern "{0}"	
prepared-query-cached: Query "{0}" is cached."	
prepared-query-not-cachable: Query "{0}" is not fit for caching.
prepared-query-invalidate: Query "{0}" is invalidated and removed from cache.
prepared-query-uncache: Query "{0}" is removed from cache {1}.
prepared-query-remove-pattern: Removing exclusion pattern "{0}" caused \
	query to be cacheable again.
uparam-mismatch: Supplied user parameters "{1}" do not match expected \
	parameters "{0}" for the prepared query "{2}". 
uparam-null: No user parameter was given. Expected parameters "{0}" for the \
	prepared query "{1}".
uparam-coll-size: Parameter "{0}" has a value "{1}" which is not compatible \
	with the available positions {2} in the parameter list of the prepared query
uparam-no-pos: User parameter "{0}" does not appear in any position in the \
	prepared query "{1}".
uparam-pc-key: Class "{0}" uses {1} primary key columns but corresponding \
	positions {2} in the parameter list of the prepared query is not compatible.
uparam-missing: Parameter {0} in SQL Query "{1}" is not given a value. The \
	parameters given is "{2}".   
optimistic-violation-lock: An optimistic lock violation was detected when \
    locking object instance.
sql-warning: The statement resulted in SQL warning: {0}
bad-fetch-mode: Invalid fetch mode. Valid values are \
    "none"(0), "join"(1) or "parallel"(2). Specified value: {0}.
bad-resultset-type: Invalid result set type. Valid values are \
    "forward-only"(1003), "scroll-insensitive"(1004) or \
    "scroll-sensitive"(1005). Specified value: {0}.
bad-fetch-direction: Invalid fetch direction. Valid values are \
    "forward"(1000), "reverse"(1001) or "unknown"(1002). Specified value: {0}.

    "unknown"(0), "last"(1) or "query"(2). Specified value: {0}.
bad-join-syntax: Invalid join syntax. Valid values are \
    "sql92"(0), "tradition"(1) or "database"(2). Specified value: {0}.
exclude-multi-select: Query "{0}" is not cached because it generates multiple \
    SQL statements. A query can be cached only when it corresponds to a single \
    SQL statement.  
exclude-not-result: Query "{0}" is not cached because it returns a single value \
    rather than a list. A query that returns single value can not be cached. 
exclude-no-user-object: Query "{0}" is not cached because post-execution data \
    can not be extracted from this query.
exclude-no-sql: Query "{0}" is not cached because SQL statement can not be \
    extracted from this query.
exclude-no-select: Query "{0}" is not cached because the internal select \
    can not be extracted from this query.
exclude-not-select-rop: Query "{0}" is not cached because its result \
    is not obtained by executing a select statement. This can happen \
    if the query was evaluated in-memory. The result was provided by {1}.  
exclude-not-executor: Query "{0}" is not cached because it was not executed on a \
    data store.    
exclude-externalized-param: Query "{0}" is not cached because some parameterized \
    field values are externalized.  
exclude-in-expression: Query "{0}" is not cached because it uses IN expression with \
	variable-length parameter.
exclude-user-strategy: Query "{0}" is not cached because some parameterized \
    field value depends on user-defined field strategy.        
exclude-pagination: Query "{0}" is not cached because it uses pagination.
fallback-no-seq-cache: Unable to cache sequence values for sequence "{0}". \
    Your application does not have permission to run an ALTER SEQUENCE \
    command. Ensure that it has the appropriate permission to run an \
    ALTER SEQUENCE command.
