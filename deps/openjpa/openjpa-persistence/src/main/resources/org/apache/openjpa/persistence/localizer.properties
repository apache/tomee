access-empty: Found no persistent property in "{0}"
access-mixed: Class "{0}" annotated fields "{1}" with FIELD access and \
	methods "{2}" with PROPERTY access. As class "{0}" is not using an  \
	explicit access, it is not permitted to mix PROPERTY and FIELD access \
	annotations.
access-none: Property "{1}" in class "{0}" is not annotated an instance field \
    or a getter method. It is not possible to determine its access type
access-unknown: Access style for "{0}" can not be determined.
access-no-property: No field or getter method for attribute "{1}" can be found \
	in "{0}".
access-default: Access style for "{0}" can not be determined.  The default "{1}" will be used. \
    If this access style is not correct, specify the correct style explicitly on the \
    persistent type or within the mapping file.
close-invoked: You have closed the EntityManager, though the persistence \
    context will remain active until the current transaction commits.
no-managed-trans: There is no managed transaction in progress to sync this \
	EntityManager with.

	transactions.

	can only perform this operation during an active transaction.

	annotations.
unsupported: OpenJPA does not yet support "{1}" as used in "{0}".

	persistence strategy "{1}".  Please choose a different strategy.
no-pers-strat: Fields "{0}" are not a default persistent type, and do not \
	have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy. They will \
	be treated as non-persistent. If you intended for these fields to be \
	persistent, be sure to annotate them appropriately. Otherwise annotate \
	them with @Transient.
generator-bad-strategy: "{0}" declares generator name "{1}", but uses the AUTO \
	generation type.  The only valid generator names under AUTO are "uuid-hex" \
	and "uuid-string".

	must have names.
