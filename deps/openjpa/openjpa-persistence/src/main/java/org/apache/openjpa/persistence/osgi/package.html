<p><strong>OpenJPA JPA</strong></p>

<p>
    This package bridges OpenJPA as a OSGi Bundle. 
</p>
    This package while making OpenJPA runtime available as a OSGi Bundle also
    ensures that OpenJPA runtime has no mandatory runtime dependency on OSGi libraries
    when operating in a non-OSGi environment.
