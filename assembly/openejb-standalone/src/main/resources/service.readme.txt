Windows NT Service
==================

The two batch files for creating and removing OpenEJB as a Windows Service are basically
self explanatory. Both scripts must be run using an account that has rights to install
or de-install a service. This is usually an administrator account.

service.install.as.admin.bat
service.remove.as.admin.bat

If a 'jre' or 'jdk' directory is found in an adjacent path to this 'bin' directory then
this will be used as the preferred runtime, else the installed system runtime is used.

NOTE: If you modify either of these batch files then ensure that there are no hidden
characters after the '^' continuation symbol (such as tab or space). But always ensure
there is a space before (and not a tab). The service installer will drop further options
and simply warn that '++JvmOptions' is unknown, leading to unexpected results.

++JvmOptions=-Dopenejb.home="%openejb%" ^
++JvmOptions=-Xms128M ^[tab or space] <-- Will break here, no further options will be appended
++JvmOptions=-Xmx512M ^
++JvmOptions=-XX:MaxPermSize=256M <-- Last line has no continuation symbol

Using the Monitor
=================
The file named 'OpenEJBServer.exe' can be used to modify service parameters post installation by running as an Administrator.
To use the monitor feature:

1. Create a shortcut to 'OpenEJBServer.exe' in your 'Startup' directory
2. Right click the shortcut and select 'Properties'
3. Edit the 'Target' field and append  //MS to the end of the line (Do not forget the preceding space ...\bin\OpenEJBServer.exe //MS)
