# iTest Common

iTest Common is similar to iTest Util, but dependencies are allowed. We should still try to keep iTest Common from getting too bloated.  For example if we end up with a great deal of code focused on say http calls, pulling in http clients and tracing libraries, we may want to eventually throw that into a dedicated module.  Meanwhile, iTest Common is fine place to house that code till it grows into something bigger and more worthy of its own module.
